<!-- <h1>2018 Swedish General Election</h1>
Our Swedish general election happened on September 9th and the government makes all voter data available to the public.
This data is however fairly difficult to navigate in an effective way! I, being a problem solver, am in the process of creating a visualization tool that organizes the data and allows
users to browse it more easily with the goal of spotting trends and patterns!<br><br>

<h1>SKL</h1>
In my professional life I'm currently working as a freelance visualization specialist for Sveriges Kommuner och Landsting (Swedish association of local authorities and regions) on a project called <a href="http://skoldigiplan.se/">#skolDigiPlan</a>.
My role in this project is to measure and to create a visualization tool for user engagement, to elucidate discussion results based on pre-determined questions from their forum like tool and to provide feedback on the discussion platform they use (called VoteIT).
My second responsibility is to create a visualization tool for in support of the appropriate users can create their own strategic action plans when implementing digitization methods within a school setting.
<br><br>
<a href="/SKL-Visualization/BubbleV2/">Here</a> is a link to the project. Please note that it is a work in progress and will be updated throughout this entire process! This project officially launches in March 2019.

<!-- Information Visualization has become a quiet big interest of mine as of recent and I am currently working on prepartions for my Masters Thesis. This will combine one of my biggest hobbies, beer, and computer science. More to come soon! -->
<!-- <br><br><br>Other projects, which can be previewd below include a visualization program easily displaying sports and esports statistics. Another visualization application in the pipeline is a project called MT Map. The intention is to create an interactable map in which a user can plan potential vacations or trips! -->

<h1>Viable Cities</h1>
Another client of mine is <a href="http://viablecities.com">Viable Cities</a> - a strategic innovation programme for research and innovation in the field of smart, sustainable cities.
My role in this project is to visualize their project portfolio and to create a matchmaking analysis tool for their internal strategic partners and associated projects.
<br><br>
<a href="/ViableCities/">Here</a> is a link to this project. Please note that it is a work in progress and will be updated throughout this entire process! This project officially launches on December 4th.

<h1>Garmin Running Data</h1>
Long distance running is my main hobby right now and in June 2018 I ran my first Marathon (and the second on September 1st, 2018). Running a marathon requires a lot of preparation and practice - something that can be tracked!
With the use of my new Garmin Forerunner 235 tempo watch I'm able to extract each activity session and collect a ton of super interesting data!
Seeing as one of my favourite activities is to visualize data, the only logical thing to do next was to create a cool interactive tool which I can
use on my journey!<br><br>

<!-- <h1>Master Thesis</h1>
Professionally, I'm currently working on my Masters Thesis that entails creating a visualization system for a brewery. More to come on that at a later date!

Recently I've been working on a modular 3D Engine. The main focus as of now is to transfer my project from Java into C++ (which is almost complete) and then to implement different Anti-Aliasing techniques and studying how these work.  <a href="portfolio/gl_engine.html">Click here</a> to see more about it!</div>
