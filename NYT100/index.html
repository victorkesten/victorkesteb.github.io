New Year’s Eve. A song. A conversation. A month later and nothing was more clear than that this was ‘it’. We both knew so without a doubt. And what is amazing - even to this day, is that it really was true. It <b>is</b> true. But the timing was not right. We weren’t ready. And you couldn’t wait. You wouldn’t wait. And now that we are ready - now that everything we planned can happen, you’ve vanished into thin air and left me behind without a care. But I know you still have the compass. And you know how to find your way home. I know you do. I’ll always be your home. Your rock.
