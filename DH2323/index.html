						Saturn has a prominent ring system that consists of nine continuous main rings and three discontinuous arcs, composed mostly of ice particles with a smaller amount of rocky debris and dust. Sixty-two known moons orbit the planet, of which fifty-three are officially named. This does not include the hundreds of "moonlets" comprising the rings.

						I've attempted creating post-processing support to my engine. However this was not as easy as I thought it would be. To do this I would need to restructure how I load and store textures as well as how each game object and component is rendered. This is not an easy task and I don't believe I am up for changing it unfortunately. I believe I may have to change my project specification unfortunately and put something I've already dont instead.

						I have not had much time to work on the engine this autumn due to incredlbe amount of work from other courses. However with the spring term starting up I have new goals in mind and will continue working.

					I've spent all of june figuring out lighting and writing proper lighting code for the engine. I wanted to take what we learned in class and apply it to the engine - Diffuse, Specular and Ambient lighting. Writing the shader classes was not too difficult as

						This is where I begin my journey. Initially I googled everything I could find on OpenGL and how to take that which we learned from the labs one step further. I ended up learning from a site called <a href="http://ogldev.atspace.co.uk">OGL Dev</a> how to draw triangles, how to transform them and how to render them as 3D.

					<p>This essentially meant writing my own mathematics classes, a transform class and a shader support class. One of the key goals for the engine was for it to be scalable and therefore using good programming practices when creating classes and methods was very important. With the help of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/thebennybox/">The Benny Box</a> on YouTube I was able to create a class structure that worked well for what I had in mind.  </p>

					Finally I had something that was presentable - a 3D model that could be transformed and rotated as much as I pleased
