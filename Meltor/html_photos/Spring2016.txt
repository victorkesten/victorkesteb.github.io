<a data-fancybox="gallery" data-caption="I think this photo was taken the first time we 'met' in person when I took the train to Arlanda. I was so nervous and excited. I knew the first night that I had met the right person and that this was no fluke." href="resources/2016/Spring/DSC_0694.JPG"><img class="thumb_t" src="resources/2016/Spring/DSC_0694t.jpg"></a>

<a data-fancybox="gallery" data-caption="It happened more than once. Since we were a lot 'poorer' back then, we cooked way more at home. Cooking with you Melani is one of my favourite things ever.

<a data-fancybox="gallery" data-caption="When we were together we went on every date we could, even though money was tight.

<a data-fancybox="gallery" data-caption="We were so happy. I think the distance really hurt us. But this happiness is what I see every time we're together, alone.

<a data-fancybox="gallery" data-caption="Game of Thrones night! The day Game of Thrones Season 6 Episode 1 came out we were lucky enough to be together and heck yeah - we would celebrate it with a feast. We really went all out. I miss cooking with you.

<a data-fancybox="gallery" data-caption="There is not much more to say about the rest of these photos. Only that I believe that we were so incredibly in love when we were together in person and that the distance is probably what hurt us the most. We were so close to finally closing that distance and being done with that phase of our lives. It makes me sad seeing these photos because it makes me realize how lovely it was to spend all of that time with you and how lovely it could've been in the future. What can be our future." href="resources/2016/Spring/2.jpg"><img class="thumb_t" src="resources/2016/Spring/2.jpg"></a>
