  This page will remain up as a legacy for some of the best moments in my life. I don't even know if you ever went on this page to begin with but given the chance that you ever do dig out the link and visit it, just know you can always contact me. Even if it's just to talk, say hi and catch up or to be friends. If you need an arm to cry on or the need to discuss the latest GoT episode! We may not have worked out as lovers during this time but were afterall, best friends. You know my email: <i>victorkesten@gmail.com</i>. I will respect you and your life choices by not being the one to initiate contact. But you can <u>always</u>, always contact me. I forgive you for breaking my heart because I know you're a good person. I don't think you meant to hurt me the way you did.
<br><br>A project I was going to show you that I started a while back for us was this map software where we could plan our world trips, places to live and vacations together, on our own website. Clicking on a country would bring up the country in full (try clicking on America) and allow you to make lists of places you wanna visit, things to do or list things you've done there and if you would go again. <a href="/MeltorsMap">Click Here!</a> I will finish what I originally had in mind for this website as it's actually a really good business idea, but I'll not use our dreams as test-data anymore because I assume you don't want me to. This subsite however will also remain as a legacy and maybe when the core is ready, I will fill out the rest regardless.  

<br><br>There was a time when you actually loved me and saw us being together forever. You did for a reason but ultimately it was the distance ripped us apart. Everything can honestly be blamed on the distance. I saw you as my soulmate and was ready to spend the rest of my life with you. If it was meant to be then fate will somehow reunite us. But it also doesn't have to be like that. It was always us against the world.
<br><br>These two old letters embody what was us. <a data-fancybox="gallery" href="resources/DSC_2193.JPG">Letter 1</a>,<a data-fancybox="gallery" href="resources/DSC_2194.JPG">Letter 1 Cover</a>, <a data-fancybox="gallery" href="resources/DSC_2195.JPG">Letter 2</a> and lastly the <a data-fancybox="gallery" href="resources/DSC_2197.JPG">Pillow Case</a>, <a data-fancybox="gallery" href="resources/DSC_2198.JPG">1</a>,<a data-fancybox="gallery" href="resources/DSC_2199.JPG">2</a>,<a data-fancybox="gallery" href="resources/DSC_2200.JPG">3</a>
