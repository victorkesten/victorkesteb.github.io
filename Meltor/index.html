  <hr style="width:20%;border: 1px solid black">
  <b>December 25:</b> Merry Christmas. I hope you have a good day. Tomorrow we're renting a car and driving around the island.
  I do wish you were here. 
  <br><br>
  <b>December 23:</b>Pearl Harbor was nice. It was the same as you and I went on but fun for the family to see it too.
  It's so cold here though compared to what I am used to. Tomorrow is Christmas eve and I'm super excited (as you know, Christmas is my favorite). We're doing
  some late afternoon whale watching tour that leaves from some bay near Ala Moana. Gonna get everyone shave ice tomorrow
  and have them try a bunch of Hawaiian food! It's exciting. I hope you're well. I know that in a different multiverse/timeline
  you would be with us and for some reason that is slightly comforting. Hope you're having a good holiday season. I removed
  all my writing on the writing page early yesterday morning. I don't know if you ever read them, but I want that page to go
  in a different direction. What was written within will go into a single pdf that says everything that needs to be said. Like I
  wrote way down below - it would be great to see you.
  <br><br>
  <b>December 22:</b> Well I am traveling today. We live in downtown Honolulu along the Ala Wai canal close to Eaton Square.
  Got a ton of activities planned and things to do. Wish you were there with us.. There are a million things
  I want to talk to you about and show you. You'd be so incredibly proud of my recent achievements as well as my
  personal growth over these past few months. When I said things would be different, I did truly mean it but I never realized it would be
  like this (in a good way). I'm just gonna write quick updates here every day while I'm in Hawaii.
   At least I can pretend you're reading and make myself feel a little bit better about being here. And given the chance you
   do read it, you know where not to go if you want to avoid me.<br><br>
   I am going to send your mom a message because I think I owe your parents a big thank you for having been so lovely
   to me when we were together. I hope that's ok. Tomorrow we will do the Pearl Harbor tour that you and I did (but with a
   different groupon option thing). And after that probably just stroll around Waikiki and enjoy our vacation. Because that
   is why we are here. Vacation. That's all.

All that is gold does not glitter,<br>
Not all those who wander are lost. <br>
The old that is strong does not wither, <br>
Deep roots are not reached by the frost. <br><br>
From the ashes a fire shall be woken,<br>
A light from the shadows shall spring. <br>
Renewed shall be blade that was broken,<br>
The crownless shall be King again.
</i>
<br><br>
Send me an email the day you are ready to talk. You never gave yourself that opportunity. Know that I think about you <u>every</u> day.
If you ever need me, I will be with you as soon as I can.

<br><br>If you do end up going on this page before Christmas,
know that I will be in Hawaii between the 22nd-31st.
It would be good to see you and to talk then.
I'm asking you to do it, not for me, but for you. Please email me if this is okay.
I don't want to disturb you unless absolutely necessary which is why I'm asking this on Meltor and not via email or text.
It probably won't reach you.. But given the chance you're here reading this it means you've given us thought and maybe meeting isn't such a bad idea.
