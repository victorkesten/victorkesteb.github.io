  <!-- I guess if you ever learn HTML and view source you can read my comments to some of this. -->
  The day you read this means you've given us thought. Maybe you miss me. Know that I miss you.
  This page is here because I still think about you every day and still care about you. You were my world and also my best friend.
  The day this page is not here means I've moved on. But given how I am as a person and what you were to me, that won't ever happen.<br><br>
  Send me an email the day you feel like you are ready to talk.
  <!-- I will always love you. I will forever hurt.  -->
  <!-- I said I would never want to see you again. -->
  <!-- But if you have made it this far it means you've contemplated your choices -->
  <!-- and you should know I will always reply. -->
  I will <b>always</b> reply to you. And if you ever need me for whatever reason, I will be there as soon as I can. I will always make time for you.
  <br><br>
  To me you will always be the girl with the Legolas cut out, the girl with so much talent, drive and passion, the girl with a dream to make the world a better place. Everything I have from our time has not been thrown out but only archived.
  I hope to one day see you again. And when that day comes, my arms and heart will be wide open. I believe in you.

  <!-- I am writing a lot these days. <a href="../Random/Book/">Here</a> is the story about us. You may want to read it. It's a long process to write something such grand and thus it will periodically be updated. -->

  <br><br>
  <!-- One of my favorite things in English class in High School was analyzing stories and books.Songs, and other media. -->
  <!-- I can't carry it for you. But I can carry you.  Lord of the rings, and hills.. Anecdots . We never realized thew eight of our mission - our quest. Just l ike them.-->
  <!-- The ring is whatever it is oyu are feeling inside. Let it go.  -->
  <!-- I expected this outcome but I did want to give you the chance. I'll leave you with this: Growth is painful. Change is painful. But nothing is as painful as staying stuck somewhere you don't belong. Doubt kills more dreams than failure ever will. But it's evidently clear you can only figure that out on your own. The day you feel like you're ready to talk, go on my website and check /Meltor/. I will be waiting. Why? Because I believe in you. -->
