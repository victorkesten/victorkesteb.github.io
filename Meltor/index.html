  <a class="title">Us Against the World</a><br>
  <!-- <a class="date">3 November 2017</a> -->
  <hr style="width:20%;border: 1px solid black">
  The day you read this means you've given us thought. Maybe you miss me. Know that I miss you.
  This page is here because I still think about you every day and still care about you. You were my world and also my best friend.
  You shouldn't be surprised that I was so insistent and not willing to give up after we broke up. I did think we'd be together forever - to work through problems and together succeed and fulfill our dreams.

  <br><br>
  However, I forgive you for what happened. I do this for my own sake. I've let go of the anger and guilt and I only feel bad for you these days. I feel so sad that you will miss out on the dreams we planned for those dreams were incredible and all we could ever ask for. But I don't think what you did is what actually you wanted deep within but only saw it as the easiest temporary escape given our difficult situation.  
<br><br>
<i>
All that is gold does not glitter,<br>
Not all those who wander are lost. <br>
The old that is strong does not wither, <br>
Deep roots are not reached by the frost. <br><br>
From the ashes a fire shall be woken,<br>
A light from the shadows shall spring. <br>
Renewed shall be blade that was broken,<br>
The crownless shall be King again.
</i>

  <br><br>
  Send me an email the day you feel like you are ready to talk. And I do mean talk. I want to hear from you - your real perspective and thoughts. You never gave yourself that opportunity.

  I will <b>always</b> reply to you. If there is any truth to the poem above then this will hopefully happen for our love was deeply rooted and can always be woken from the ashes. You just have to give yourself that opportunity.

   <!-- And if you ever need me for whatever reason, I will be there as soon as I can. I will always make time for you. -->
  <br><br>
  To me you will always be the girl with the Legolas cut out, the girl with so much talent, drive and passion, the girl with a dream to make a difference in the daunting world we live in and to ultimately make the world a better place.
  It's never too late to be the person you want to be. I hope you live a life you're proud of and happy with, and if you find that you're not, I hope you have the strength to start over. If so, I want to be there and do it with you for I know that together we can achieve anything.

  <br><br>Everything I have from our time has not been thrown out but only archived.
  I hope to one day see you again. And when that day comes, my arms will be wide open. We deserve that. There are a million things I want to tell you and do with you.
  <!-- I believe in you. We could make our wildest dreams come true, together, just like how we always planned. -->
<br><br>
  Ask me about my writing if you're uncertain. I've written poems, stories, songs and letters about us.
<!-- I am still going to be writing. But I am not going to send you anything directly. If you want to read what I write, go here: <a href="http://www.victorkesten.com/Random/Writing/">Link</a>. It'll be a bit of everything. -->
