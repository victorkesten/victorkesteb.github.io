  <b>December 22:</b> Well I am traveling today. We live in downtown Honolulu along the Ala Wai canal close to Eaton Square.
  Got a ton of activities planned and things to do. Wish you were there with us.. There are a million things
  I have to say to you and show you. You'd be so incredibly proud of my recent achievements as well as my
  personal growth over these past few months. When I said things would be different, I did truly mean it.
  I'm just gonna write quick updates here every day while I'm in Hawaii. At least I can pretend you're reading
  and make myself feel a little bit better about being here.

All that is gold does not glitter,<br>
Not all those who wander are lost. <br>
The old that is strong does not wither, <br>
Deep roots are not reached by the frost. <br><br>
From the ashes a fire shall be woken,<br>
A light from the shadows shall spring. <br>
Renewed shall be blade that was broken,<br>
The crownless shall be King again.

Send me an email the day you are ready to talk. You never gave yourself that opportunity. Know that I think about you <u>every</u> day.
If you ever need me, I will be with you as soon as I can. Here is my <a href="/Random/Writing/">writing</a>. Some is sentimental but all of it is honest.

<br><br>If you do end up going on this page before Christmas,
know that I will be in Hawaii between the 22nd-31st.
It would be good to see you and to talk then.
I'm asking you to do it, not for me, but for you. Please email me if this is okay.
I don't want to disturb you unless absolutely necessary which is why I'm asking this on Meltor and not via email or text.
It probably won't reach you.. But given the chance you're here reading this it means you've given us thought and maybe meeting isn't such a bad idea.
