  <a class="title">Us Against the World</a><br>
  <!-- <a class="date">3 November 2017</a> -->
  <hr style="width:20%;border: 1px solid black">
  The day you read this means you've given us thought. Maybe you miss me. Know that I miss you.
  This page is here because I still think about you every day and still care about you. You were my world and also my best friend.
  You shouldn't be surprised that I was so insistent and not willing to give up after we broke up. I did think we'd be together forever - to work through problems and together succeed and fulfill our dreams.
  <br><br>
  Send me an email the day you feel like you are ready to talk. And I do mean talk. I want to hear from you - your perspective and thoughts. You never gave yourself that opportunity. 

  I will <b>always</b> reply to you. And if you ever need me for whatever reason, I will be there as soon as I can. I will always make time for you.
  <br><br>
  To me you will always be the girl with the Legolas cut out, the girl with so much talent, drive and passion, the girl with a dream to make the world a better place. Everything I have from our time has not been thrown out but only archived.
  I hope to one day see you again. And when that day comes, my arms will be wide open. There are a million things I want to tell you and do with you.
  <!-- I believe in you. We could make our wildest dreams come true, together, just like how we always planned. -->
<br><br>
I am still going to be writing. But I am not going to send you anything directly. If you want to read what I write, go here: <a href="http://www.victorkesten.com/Random/Writing/">Link.</a> It'll be a bit of everything.
