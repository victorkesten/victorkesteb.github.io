8/22/17, 18:30 - Victor Kesten: :/ I wonder what might help
8/22/17, 18:30 - Victor Kesten: Maybe if you read before you go to bed?
8/22/17, 18:30 - Victor Kesten: Like away from screens and stuff
8/22/17, 18:30 - Victor Kesten: And read for 30 minutes
8/22/17, 18:31 - Victor Kesten: they say that helps with insomnia
8/22/17, 18:33 - Victor Kesten: I wanna try to make that a goal for myself
8/22/17, 18:49 - Melani Carri√©: That's a good idea
8/22/17, 18:49 - Melani Carri√©: I'll try that tonight
8/22/17, 18:49 - Victor Kesten: It's worth a try :(
8/22/17, 19:09 - Melani Carri√©: i feel so shitty
8/22/17, 19:09 - Melani Carri√©: i am literally starving myslef i think

8/22/17, 19:27 - Victor Kesten: Add more food to your diet
8/22/17, 19:43 - Victor Kesten: You won't gain any muscle from that
8/22/17, 19:43 - Victor Kesten: :/
8/22/17, 19:43 - Victor Kesten: Your body will just make it harder to lose weight
8/22/17, 19:43 - Victor Kesten: Since it stores everu little bit of energy it can get
8/22/17, 19:44 - Victor Kesten: As it thinks it's being starved

8/23/17, 18:14 - Victor Kesten: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPguoeYTvMI&feature=youtu.be
8/23/17, 18:14 - Victor Kesten: This is what Blizzard do. They're like Pixar. But for their own games

8/23/17, 18:14 - Victor Kesten: I know you don't like hearthstone or anything

8/23/17, 18:14 - Victor Kesten: Amazing

8/23/17, 18:57 - Victor Kesten: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tjcm_kI0n0
8/23/17, 20:13 - Melani Carri√©: Hi
8/23/17, 20:13 - Melani Carri√©: Sorry
8/23/17, 20:13 - Melani Carri√©: I was scrambling this morning
8/23/17, 20:14 - Melani Carri√©: I'm at the Honda place now. They're changing the oil in my car and unclogging the air vents
8/23/17, 20:14 - Victor Kesten: It's fine. You said you had a busy schedule today
8/23/17, 20:14 - Melani Carri√©: Have to go pick up signs from Tricia because she didn't want to drive 10 mins to help me out and drop them at Costco (she lives in Mililani too)
8/23/17, 20:14 - Melani Carri√©: Then drive to Waikiki for brokers open
8/23/17, 20:15 - Melani Carri√©: From 9:30-12:00
8/23/17, 20:15 - Melani Carri√©: Have to text one of my clients cuz I forgot o had yoga at 5:30 so i can't stay in Waikiki until 6
8/23/17, 20:15 - Melani Carri√©: Even though they wanted showing late today
8/23/17, 20:15 - Melani Carri√©: But I need to go for my own mental sanity
8/23/17, 20:16 - Melani Carri√©: But 8:15 is too early to text normal people lol.
8/23/17, 20:16 - Melani Carri√©: I'll go over the website too at the open
8/23/17, 20:16 - Melani Carri√©: Since I doubt it'll be busy
8/23/17, 20:17 - Melani Carri√©: I can't watch the vids right now cuz I'm in a very crowded waiting room
8/23/17, 20:17 - Melani Carri√©: How was your day?
8/23/17, 20:29 - Victor Kesten: Yeah sounds like lots to do
8/23/17, 20:29 - Victor Kesten: Good thing you got yoga to relax later today
8/23/17, 20:29 - Victor Kesten: My day was OK
8/23/17, 20:30 - Victor Kesten: Pretty boring and exhausting. Tomorrow will be interesting again
8/23/17, 20:30 - Victor Kesten: And on Friday it's a half day
8/23/17, 20:30 - Victor Kesten: So almost done
8/23/17, 20:30 - Victor Kesten: Gonna try go for a run tomorrow morning
8/23/17, 20:30 - Victor Kesten: So gonna go to bed earlier today. Like at 9:30 or so
8/23/17, 20:31 - Melani Carri√©: Yeah that's a good idea
8/23/17, 20:31 - Melani Carri√©: Especially if you've been having pains still today
8/23/17, 20:31 - Melani Carri√©: :/
8/23/17, 20:34 - Melani Carri√©: I'm freezing
8/23/17, 20:34 - Melani Carri√©: I'm wearing a suit jacket and it's still ficking ice age in this waiting room
8/23/17, 20:35 - Victor Kesten: Yeah it's much better today
8/23/17, 20:35 - Victor Kesten: But I still feel it
8/23/17, 20:35 - Victor Kesten: A bit
8/23/17, 20:35 - Victor Kesten: Like a mild discomfort when I sit certain ways.
8/23/17, 20:35 - Victor Kesten: Oh damn
8/23/17, 20:35 - Victor Kesten: That sucks
8/23/17, 20:35 - Victor Kesten: Wait outside instead
8/23/17, 20:36 - Melani Carri√©: Yeah
8/23/17, 20:36 - Melani Carri√©: Probably food poisoning
8/23/17, 20:36 - Melani Carri√©: If it doesn't go in 5 days you should see doctor
8/23/17, 20:36 - Melani Carri√©: Outside is humid AF
8/23/17, 20:37 - Melani Carri√©: IMG-20170823-WA0008.jpg (file attached)
I got new piercings by the way. Now I have 3 small instead of 1 bigger up there
8/23/17, 20:37 - Victor Kesten: Well it's getting better so
8/23/17, 20:37 - Victor Kesten: I think I'll be ok
8/23/17, 20:37 - Victor Kesten: I don't get to see your face?
8/23/17, 20:38 - Melani Carri√©: Yeah that's good
8/23/17, 20:38 - Melani Carri√©: I was looking awkwardly cuz the whole room is full
8/23/17, 20:38 - Victor Kesten: Haha it's OK
8/23/17, 20:38 - Melani Carri√©: Needed a discrete pic since there are literally people all around me
8/23/17, 20:41 - Melani Carri√©: I want to get a ring
8/23/17, 20:41 - Melani Carri√©: For the helix piercing
8/23/17, 20:41 - Melani Carri√©: I found some awesome rings with opals and stuff
8/23/17, 20:41 - Melani Carri√©: And it would look cool I think, with the 2 accent piercings
8/23/17, 20:42 - Victor Kesten: Oh yeah? Should I Google opal ring haha
8/23/17, 20:42 - Victor Kesten: To see what it could look like
8/23/17, 20:42 - Melani Carri√©: No lol
8/23/17, 20:42 - Melani Carri√©: You can check the site
8/23/17, 20:42 - Melani Carri√©: Venus by Maria Tash
8/23/17, 20:42 - Melani Carri√©: Stunning earrings
8/23/17, 20:42 - Melani Carri√©: Very expensive
8/23/17, 20:43 - Melani Carri√©: But I might get one of the cheaper helix rings
8/23/17, 20:43 - Melani Carri√©: I need white gold apparently
8/23/17, 20:43 - Melani Carri√©: My piercer said 24K had trace amounts of nickel
8/23/17, 20:43 - Melani Carri√©: And I may have a nickel allergy since my helix piercings have never ever healed properly before
8/23/17, 20:43 - Melani Carri√©: Or nickel sensitivity
8/23/17, 20:44 - Victor Kesten: Ahh ok. It's sparkly
8/23/17, 20:44 - Melani Carri√©: Yeah. I also like the standard ring that has 1 diamond on it
8/23/17, 20:44 - Melani Carri√©: Something subtle and small
8/23/17, 20:45 - Melani Carri√©: I want threaded flat back piercings from Maria Tash too but my piercer said flat backs are only for fully
Healed homes
8/23/17, 20:45 - Melani Carri√©: Holes
8/23/17, 20:45 - Melani Carri√©: Otherwise it'll get stuck
8/23/17, 20:45 - Melani Carri√©: Which is terrifying
8/23/17, 20:45 - Victor Kesten: Yeah white gold is gold with a white ore alloy instead of nickel
8/23/17, 20:45 - Victor Kesten: Probably better
8/23/17, 20:45 - Melani Carri√©: Yeah
8/23/17, 20:45 - Melani Carri√©: She said that is the most hypoallergenic
8/23/17, 20:46 - Victor Kesten: What is threaded flat back
8/23/17, 20:47 - Melani Carri√©: The back of the earring is flat
8/23/17, 20:47 - Melani Carri√©: And the spike threads into the back
8/23/17, 20:47 - Melani Carri√©: Like two tubes
8/23/17, 20:47 - Melani Carri√©: So you don't get the spoke part at the back
8/23/17, 20:48 - Victor Kesten: Oh ok
8/23/17, 20:51 - Victor Kesten: Not sure I understand what the difference is visually üòÇ
8/23/17, 20:51 - Victor Kesten: But ok
8/23/17, 20:51 - Victor Kesten: I guess it's more comfortable?
8/23/17, 20:51 - Melani Carri√©: The back is flat against your skin
8/23/17, 20:51 - Melani Carri√©: Instead of sticking out
8/23/17, 20:51 - Victor Kesten: Ya I get that
8/23/17, 20:52 - Melani Carri√©: So why did you say you don't understand visual difference?
8/23/17, 20:53 - Victor Kesten: Cause people don't look behind your ear do they
8/23/17, 20:53 - Victor Kesten: Which is why I said I guess it's more comfortable
8/23/17, 20:53 - Melani Carri√©: No, not purposefully
8/23/17, 20:53 - Melani Carri√©: But it just looks less cluttered
8/23/17, 20:53 - Victor Kesten: Hm ok
8/23/17, 20:55 - Melani Carri√©: It's ok I guess it only makes sense to people who like piercings and notice lol
8/23/17, 20:56 - Victor Kesten: I guess
8/23/17, 20:57 - Victor Kesten: I think everyone notices piercings though ahah
8/23/17, 21:01 - Melani Carri√©: That's true
8/23/17, 21:01 - Melani Carri√©: But mine are small!
8/23/17, 21:01 - Melani Carri√©: Still waiting for my car
8/23/17, 21:01 - Melani Carri√©: Turning into a Popsicle
8/23/17, 21:02 - Victor Kesten: Star sparkles ‚ú®
8/23/17, 21:02 - Victor Kesten: Wow how long will it take
8/23/17, 22:14 - Melani Carri√©: Hi

8/23/17, 22:14 - Melani Carri√©: But Jesus
8/23/17, 22:37 - Melani Carri√©: You're asleep now :/ sorry I missed you
8/23/17, 22:37 - Melani Carri√©: Courtney was here
8/23/17, 22:37 - Melani Carri√©: We talked for a bit about my client
8/23/17, 22:37 - Melani Carri√©: I'm really

8/24/17, 01:22 - Melani Carri√©: I hope you're resting well ‚ù§
8/24/17, 04:29 - Melani Carri√©: Open house was pretty dead
8/24/17, 04:29 - Melani Carri√©: Did some other work when I got back to the office
8/24/17, 04:29 - Melani Carri√©: Had a hard boiled egg and toast for snack
8/24/17, 04:30 - Melani Carri√©: And some salad
8/24/17, 04:30 - Melani Carri√©: Finally picking up the freaking treadmill now!!
8/24/17, 04:30 - Melani Carri√©: If anyone will show up
8/24/17, 04:30 - Melani Carri√©: Been waiting for like 5 mins and there's literally no one here at the pickup register
8/24/17, 04:30 - Melani Carri√©: üòëüòëüòë
8/24/17, 04:30 - Melani Carri√©: I thought this was America!!
8/24/17, 04:30 - Melani Carri√©: Walmart America!!
8/24/17, 04:38 - Melani Carri√©: I've literally been waiting for over 15 mins
8/24/17, 04:40 - Melani Carri√©: This Walmart
8/24/17, 04:40 - Melani Carri√©: Wtf
8/24/17, 04:40 - Melani Carri√©: I've seen like 6 associates go by and no one gives a shit
8/24/17, 04:40 - Melani Carri√©: Full of lazy asses
8/24/17, 04:40 - Melani Carri√©: Jesus
8/24/17, 04:40 - Melani Carri√©: I guess that's the standard by which Walmart hires its employees - there is no standard üôÑ
8/24/17, 04:51 - Melani Carri√©: IMG-20170824-WA0000.jpg (file attached)
