8/22/17, 18:30 - Victor Kesten: :/ I wonder what might help
8/22/17, 18:30 - Victor Kesten: Maybe if you read before you go to bed?
8/22/17, 18:30 - Victor Kesten: Like away from screens and stuff
8/22/17, 18:30 - Victor Kesten: And read for 30 minutes
8/22/17, 18:31 - Victor Kesten: they say that helps with insomnia
8/22/17, 18:33 - Victor Kesten: I wanna try to make that a goal for myself
8/22/17, 18:49 - Melani Carri√©: That's a good idea
8/22/17, 18:49 - Melani Carri√©: I'll try that tonight
8/22/17, 18:49 - Victor Kesten: It's worth a try :(
8/22/17, 19:09 - Melani Carri√©: i feel so shitty
8/22/17, 19:09 - Melani Carri√©: i am literally starving myslef i think

8/22/17, 19:27 - Victor Kesten: Add more food to your diet
8/22/17, 19:43 - Victor Kesten: You won't gain any muscle from that
8/22/17, 19:43 - Victor Kesten: :/
8/22/17, 19:43 - Victor Kesten: Your body will just make it harder to lose weight
8/22/17, 19:43 - Victor Kesten: Since it stores everu little bit of energy it can get
8/22/17, 19:44 - Victor Kesten: As it thinks it's being starved

8/23/17, 18:14 - Victor Kesten: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPguoeYTvMI&feature=youtu.be
8/23/17, 18:14 - Victor Kesten: This is what Blizzard do. They're like Pixar. But for their own games

8/23/17, 18:14 - Victor Kesten: I know you don't like hearthstone or anything

8/23/17, 18:14 - Victor Kesten: Amazing

8/23/17, 18:57 - Victor Kesten: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tjcm_kI0n0
8/23/17, 20:13 - Melani Carri√©: Hi
8/23/17, 20:13 - Melani Carri√©: Sorry
8/23/17, 20:13 - Melani Carri√©: I was scrambling this morning
8/23/17, 20:14 - Melani Carri√©: I'm at the Honda place now. They're changing the oil in my car and unclogging the air vents
8/23/17, 20:14 - Victor Kesten: It's fine. You said you had a busy schedule today
8/23/17, 20:14 - Melani Carri√©: Have to go pick up signs from Tricia because she didn't want to drive 10 mins to help me out and drop them at Costco (she lives in Mililani too)
8/23/17, 20:14 - Melani Carri√©: Then drive to Waikiki for brokers open
8/23/17, 20:15 - Melani Carri√©: From 9:30-12:00
8/23/17, 20:15 - Melani Carri√©: Have to text one of my clients cuz I forgot o had yoga at 5:30 so i can't stay in Waikiki until 6
8/23/17, 20:15 - Melani Carri√©: Even though they wanted showing late today
8/23/17, 20:15 - Melani Carri√©: But I need to go for my own mental sanity
8/23/17, 20:16 - Melani Carri√©: But 8:15 is too early to text normal people lol.
8/23/17, 20:16 - Melani Carri√©: I'll go over the website too at the open
8/23/17, 20:16 - Melani Carri√©: Since I doubt it'll be busy
8/23/17, 20:17 - Melani Carri√©: I can't watch the vids right now cuz I'm in a very crowded waiting room
8/23/17, 20:17 - Melani Carri√©: How was your day?
8/23/17, 20:29 - Victor Kesten: Yeah sounds like lots to do
8/23/17, 20:29 - Victor Kesten: Good thing you got yoga to relax later today
8/23/17, 20:29 - Victor Kesten: My day was OK
8/23/17, 20:30 - Victor Kesten: Pretty boring and exhausting. Tomorrow will be interesting again
8/23/17, 20:30 - Victor Kesten: And on Friday it's a half day
8/23/17, 20:30 - Victor Kesten: So almost done
8/23/17, 20:30 - Victor Kesten: Gonna try go for a run tomorrow morning
8/23/17, 20:30 - Victor Kesten: So gonna go to bed earlier today. Like at 9:30 or so
8/23/17, 20:31 - Melani Carri√©: Yeah that's a good idea
8/23/17, 20:31 - Melani Carri√©: Especially if you've been having pains still today
8/23/17, 20:31 - Melani Carri√©: :/
8/23/17, 20:34 - Melani Carri√©: I'm freezing
8/23/17, 20:34 - Melani Carri√©: I'm wearing a suit jacket and it's still ficking ice age in this waiting room
8/23/17, 20:35 - Victor Kesten: Yeah it's much better today
8/23/17, 20:35 - Victor Kesten: But I still feel it
8/23/17, 20:35 - Victor Kesten: A bit
8/23/17, 20:35 - Victor Kesten: Like a mild discomfort when I sit certain ways.
8/23/17, 20:35 - Victor Kesten: Oh damn
8/23/17, 20:35 - Victor Kesten: That sucks
8/23/17, 20:35 - Victor Kesten: Wait outside instead
8/23/17, 20:36 - Melani Carri√©: Yeah
8/23/17, 20:36 - Melani Carri√©: Probably food poisoning
8/23/17, 20:36 - Melani Carri√©: If it doesn't go in 5 days you should see doctor
8/23/17, 20:36 - Melani Carri√©: Outside is humid AF
8/23/17, 20:37 - Melani Carri√©: IMG-20170823-WA0008.jpg (file attached)
I got new piercings by the way. Now I have 3 small instead of 1 bigger up there
8/23/17, 20:37 - Victor Kesten: Well it's getting better so
8/23/17, 20:37 - Victor Kesten: I think I'll be ok
8/23/17, 20:37 - Victor Kesten: I don't get to see your face?
8/23/17, 20:38 - Melani Carri√©: Yeah that's good
8/23/17, 20:38 - Melani Carri√©: I was looking awkwardly cuz the whole room is full
8/23/17, 20:38 - Victor Kesten: Haha it's OK
8/23/17, 20:38 - Melani Carri√©: Needed a discrete pic since there are literally people all around me
8/23/17, 20:41 - Melani Carri√©: I want to get a ring
8/23/17, 20:41 - Melani Carri√©: For the helix piercing
8/23/17, 20:41 - Melani Carri√©: I found some awesome rings with opals and stuff
8/23/17, 20:41 - Melani Carri√©: And it would look cool I think, with the 2 accent piercings
8/23/17, 20:42 - Victor Kesten: Oh yeah? Should I Google opal ring haha
8/23/17, 20:42 - Victor Kesten: To see what it could look like
8/23/17, 20:42 - Melani Carri√©: No lol
8/23/17, 20:42 - Melani Carri√©: You can check the site
8/23/17, 20:42 - Melani Carri√©: Venus by Maria Tash
8/23/17, 20:42 - Melani Carri√©: Stunning earrings
8/23/17, 20:42 - Melani Carri√©: Very expensive
8/23/17, 20:43 - Melani Carri√©: But I might get one of the cheaper helix rings
8/23/17, 20:43 - Melani Carri√©: I need white gold apparently
8/23/17, 20:43 - Melani Carri√©: My piercer said 24K had trace amounts of nickel
8/23/17, 20:43 - Melani Carri√©: And I may have a nickel allergy since my helix piercings have never ever healed properly before
8/23/17, 20:43 - Melani Carri√©: Or nickel sensitivity
8/23/17, 20:44 - Victor Kesten: Ahh ok. It's sparkly
8/23/17, 20:44 - Melani Carri√©: Yeah. I also like the standard ring that has 1 diamond on it
8/23/17, 20:44 - Melani Carri√©: Something subtle and small
8/23/17, 20:45 - Melani Carri√©: I want threaded flat back piercings from Maria Tash too but my piercer said flat backs are only for fully
Healed homes
8/23/17, 20:45 - Melani Carri√©: Holes
8/23/17, 20:45 - Melani Carri√©: Otherwise it'll get stuck
8/23/17, 20:45 - Melani Carri√©: Which is terrifying
8/23/17, 20:45 - Victor Kesten: Yeah white gold is gold with a white ore alloy instead of nickel
8/23/17, 20:45 - Victor Kesten: Probably better
8/23/17, 20:45 - Melani Carri√©: Yeah
8/23/17, 20:45 - Melani Carri√©: She said that is the most hypoallergenic
8/23/17, 20:46 - Victor Kesten: What is threaded flat back
8/23/17, 20:47 - Melani Carri√©: The back of the earring is flat
8/23/17, 20:47 - Melani Carri√©: And the spike threads into the back
8/23/17, 20:47 - Melani Carri√©: Like two tubes
8/23/17, 20:47 - Melani Carri√©: So you don't get the spoke part at the back
8/23/17, 20:48 - Victor Kesten: Oh ok
8/23/17, 20:51 - Victor Kesten: Not sure I understand what the difference is visually üòÇ
8/23/17, 20:51 - Victor Kesten: But ok
8/23/17, 20:51 - Victor Kesten: I guess it's more comfortable?
8/23/17, 20:51 - Melani Carri√©: The back is flat against your skin
8/23/17, 20:51 - Melani Carri√©: Instead of sticking out
8/23/17, 20:51 - Victor Kesten: Ya I get that
8/23/17, 20:52 - Melani Carri√©: So why did you say you don't understand visual difference?
8/23/17, 20:53 - Victor Kesten: Cause people don't look behind your ear do they
8/23/17, 20:53 - Victor Kesten: Which is why I said I guess it's more comfortable
8/23/17, 20:53 - Melani Carri√©: No, not purposefully
8/23/17, 20:53 - Melani Carri√©: But it just looks less cluttered
8/23/17, 20:53 - Victor Kesten: Hm ok
8/23/17, 20:55 - Melani Carri√©: It's ok I guess it only makes sense to people who like piercings and notice lol
8/23/17, 20:56 - Victor Kesten: I guess
8/23/17, 20:57 - Victor Kesten: I think everyone notices piercings though ahah
8/23/17, 21:01 - Melani Carri√©: That's true
8/23/17, 21:01 - Melani Carri√©: But mine are small!
8/23/17, 21:01 - Melani Carri√©: Still waiting for my car
8/23/17, 21:01 - Melani Carri√©: Turning into a Popsicle
8/23/17, 21:02 - Victor Kesten: Star sparkles ‚ú®
8/23/17, 21:02 - Victor Kesten: Wow how long will it take
8/23/17, 22:14 - Melani Carri√©: Hi

8/23/17, 22:14 - Melani Carri√©: But Jesus
8/23/17, 22:37 - Melani Carri√©: You're asleep now :/ sorry I missed you
8/23/17, 22:37 - Melani Carri√©: Courtney was here
8/23/17, 22:37 - Melani Carri√©: We talked for a bit about my client
8/23/17, 22:37 - Melani Carri√©: I'm really

8/24/17, 01:22 - Melani Carri√©: I hope you're resting well ‚ù§
8/24/17, 04:29 - Melani Carri√©: Open house was pretty dead
8/24/17, 04:29 - Melani Carri√©: Did some other work when I got back to the office
8/24/17, 04:29 - Melani Carri√©: Had a hard boiled egg and toast for snack
8/24/17, 04:30 - Melani Carri√©: And some salad
8/24/17, 04:30 - Melani Carri√©: Finally picking up the freaking treadmill now!!
8/24/17, 04:30 - Melani Carri√©: If anyone will show up
8/24/17, 04:30 - Melani Carri√©: Been waiting for like 5 mins and there's literally no one here at the pickup register
8/24/17, 04:30 - Melani Carri√©: üòëüòëüòë
8/24/17, 04:30 - Melani Carri√©: I thought this was America!!
8/24/17, 04:30 - Melani Carri√©: Walmart America!!
8/24/17, 04:38 - Melani Carri√©: I've literally been waiting for over 15 mins
8/24/17, 04:40 - Melani Carri√©: This Walmart
8/24/17, 04:40 - Melani Carri√©: Wtf
8/24/17, 04:40 - Melani Carri√©: I've seen like 6 associates go by and no one gives a shit
8/24/17, 04:40 - Melani Carri√©: Full of lazy asses
8/24/17, 04:40 - Melani Carri√©: Jesus
8/24/17, 04:40 - Melani Carri√©: I guess that's the standard by which Walmart hires its employees - there is no standard üôÑ
8/24/17, 04:51 - Melani Carri√©: IMG-20170824-WA0000.jpg (file attached)

8/25/17, 21:58 - Victor Kesten: Got my certificate or participation
8/25/17, 21:58 - Victor Kesten: And then tonight I went out with Jinn, David and Martin
8/25/17, 21:58 - Victor Kesten: I must not have seen them for a year
8/25/17, 21:58 - Victor Kesten: So it was great catching up
8/25/17, 21:59 - Victor Kesten: Me and David tried a bunch of beers
8/25/17, 22:00 - Victor Kesten: Which was nice. I know I said I'd stop drinking beer for a bit but catching up with them seemed like a beer appropriate moment. So. It's like my vegetarianism. I won't completely stop eating meat but avoid it mostly! I had a haloumi burger, instead of meat, and a few beers. It was really really really nice catching up wit htem.
8/25/17, 22:00 - Victor Kesten: I will probably see them more this autumn.
8/25/17, 22:00 - Victor Kesten: What happened to your hip? How did you fall? Does it have to do with your bruise on your foot?

8/25/17, 22:59 - Melani Carri√©: can you resend hosting sites and search engine site?
8/25/17, 22:59 - Melani Carri√©: that you found that would be good
8/25/17, 23:01 - Victor Kesten: Yeah. Well. I think lower-paid workers get paid more than 'lower paid' workers in the US fo rsure
8/25/17, 23:01 - Victor Kesten: and higher paid workers get paid way more in the US than here
8/25/17, 23:01 - Victor Kesten: It's more 'fair'
8/25/17, 23:01 - Victor Kesten: aka. socialism.
8/25/17, 23:01 - Victor Kesten: and when I say high paid workers I mean $100K+ every year
8/25/17, 23:02 - Victor Kesten: Hosting sites: idk. I really don't know. I mean maybe Godaddy is a good option? No idea.
8/25/17, 23:02 - Victor Kesten: ESearch engine

8/25/17, 23:02 - Victor Kesten: for the search engine
8/25/17, 23:03 - Victor Kesten: Hosting should realistically be less than $10 per month
8/25/17, 23:03 - Victor Kesten: or about that
8/25/17, 23:03 - Victor Kesten: and the search engine - well it depends on what you want!
8/25/17, 23:03 - Victor Kesten: I do believe the "Lite" version on that website is plenty fine

8/28/17, 08:53 - Victor Kesten: Pretty good
8/28/17, 08:54 - Victor Kesten: Although I can't say the wow factor was there since I already knew what was gonna happen. Gonna avoid all spoilers for next season.
8/28/17, 08:59 - Victor Kesten: Who's the friend?
8/28/17, 09:03 - Melani Carri√©: yeah
8/28/17, 09:04 - Melani Carri√©: it was fine
8/28/17, 09:04 - Melani Carri√©: Baron - met him at the hawaiian mission house volunteer. He works there with Po'ai, who was also there - she's annoying to watch shows with but she's cool. And other friend Malia.
8/28/17, 09:04 - Melani Carri√©: We're gonna do something this week as well
8/28/17, 09:05 - Melani Carri√©: so that's fun
8/28/17, 09:05 - Melani Carri√©: Im gonna take a shower now

8/28/17, 09:05 - Melani Carri√©: I'm looking at it now and it doesn't look any different.
8/28/17, 09:05 - Victor Kesten: I did not.

8/28/17, 09:22 - Melani Carri√©: i may just pay for it on my card and get reimbursed if courtney and ted are not available tomorrow.
8/28/17, 09:39 - Victor Kesten: How's your week looking
8/28/17, 10:12 - Melani Carri√©: Pretty busy I think
8/28/17, 10:12 - Melani Carri√©: Opening escrow for another property for Courtney
8/28/17, 10:12 - Melani Carri√©: Destaging and selling furniture from one that's about to close
8/28/17, 10:12 - Melani Carri√©: Hopefully opening my own soon
8/28/17, 10:13 - Melani Carri√©: Finishing website
8/28/17, 10:13 - Melani Carri√©: Adding 2 new listings
8/28/17, 10:13 - Melani Carri√©: Cleaning the fucking house cuz my grandma never does it.
8/28/17, 10:14 - Melani Carri√©: Setting up treadmill cuz haven't had time to do so
8/28/17, 10:15 - Melani Carri√©: I'm just tired.
8/28/17, 10:15 - Melani Carri√©: Haven't taken a shower yet either
8/28/17, 10:15 - Melani Carri√©: Been going through stuff for work
8/28/17, 10:15 - Victor Kesten: Oh alright
8/28/17, 10:15 - Victor Kesten: Well take a shower and go to bed
8/28/17, 10:20 - Victor Kesten: Surely you're tired after such a busy week
8/28/17, 10:33 - Melani Carri√©: yeah
8/28/17, 10:33 - Melani Carri√©: I will
8/28/17, 10:33 - Melani Carri√©: brb
8/28/17, 10:36 - Victor Kesten: Alright
8/28/17, 12:04 - Victor Kesten: Who showers for 1.5h
8/28/17, 14:39 - Victor Kesten: You‚Äôve been basically absent for the past week and when we do get a chance to talk, the first thing you mention is work and the website. I get that you‚Äôve had a lot going on last week but the fact that you have had 0 time to message me during your days for SO many days in a row is ridiculous. Especially on the weekend. And when I am awake and you‚Äôre also awake you‚Äôre either away, not responding or doing things that make it so you take literally like 30-60minutes to reply.  

You asked me on Thursday if I was mad at you. Or something like ‚ÄúDo you despise me‚Äù. Already then it had been going on for a few days. Well. I wasn‚Äôt then. Only a tad bit surprised at how busy you suddenly got. But now it‚Äôs Monday and I am pretty upset. A few days of this ‚Äì fine. I get that. We all have busy periods and it‚Äôs cool. 

But If you‚Äôre doing so many things so that you don‚Äôt even have time to message me ‚Äì your ldr boyfriend, then you should reevaluate your commitments and prioritize things. We rely on consistent communication for this long distance thing to work‚Ä¶ How long does it take to send a few quick messages letting me know what you‚Äôre up to or how you‚Äôre feeling? Letting me know what interesting/boring things you‚Äôve done or whatever. Anything. The mundane stuff that would normally be discussed if we were together in person anyways. It‚Äôs always the small things that make a difference. You haven‚Äôt said you love or that you miss me even.

You‚Äôve pretty much given me zero attention except for a quick few messages, if that, in the evening/morning saying ‚Äúsorry for no messages today ‚Äì so much to do‚Äù or mentioning the website - more work stuff when you really should be relaxing instead and doing something non-work related. And it just makes me sad. So I‚Äôm asking you to please try to make time for me too‚Ä¶
8/28/17, 20:18 - Melani Carri√©: I wasn‚Äôt showering for an hour and a half. I didn‚Äôt even get to shower. I was so tired that I just fell asleep. 

Regardless of that, you‚Äôre right, I have been busy. And I‚Äôm sorry that I haven‚Äôt had time to talk to you throughout the week, but I don‚Äôt think you fully understand just how much I have to do throughout the day. Only now am I just starting to get some traction of my own in this business, and that means I have to work outside of the 40 hours that I‚Äôm getting paid to work for Courtney to get things done. 

And it‚Äôs only going to get worse - once this Cherry Blossom pageant starts next week, I‚Äôm going to be gone during evenings and weekends even more than I already am. Volunteering is a crucial part of this competition, and the classes that we have to work through will take up at least 12+ extra hours a week alone. 

At the signing, they told me that if I win this (or any spot on the court), I‚Äôm going to be here and/or traveling through 2019 at the very least, because there is an additional year-long commitment after the final ceremony. Potentially through 2020, and, depending on how things go with my work, maybe even longer.

If we were together, it would be a lot easier. But we‚Äôre not - and as much as that sucks, and as much as we can try to not let it affect anything, that is literally an inescapable aspect of our relationship: that we haven‚Äôt been together at all over the past year and a half, and, honestly, we may not be for a couple more years. 

You don‚Äôt want to live here - believe me, I completely understand that. Hell no do I want to stay here forever. But I have a lot of opportunities coming up for me right now that need 110% of me, and I don‚Äôt want to move somewhere else within the next year because you found a job on the mainland or in Europe. At the same time, I don‚Äôt want you to be here when you know you don‚Äôt like it, and reject jobs that you will only resent me for later. 

Everything is just so overwhelming right now, I don‚Äôt know. Like you said, maybe we need to take some time to reevaluate things. Because the last thing I want is for us to start hating each other. And I feel like if we continue like this (me not being able to set time aside, and then feeling guilty about it, and you being upset that I can‚Äôt do that, and getting mad at me for it), that‚Äôs what‚Äôs going to happen.
8/28/17, 20:18 - Melani Carri√©: Take your time to reply to that - I have to get ready for work.
8/28/17, 20:49 - Victor Kesten: Yeah maybe I don‚Äôt understand just how much you have to do throughout the day. It‚Äôs great that you are gaining traction in the business and alright ‚Äì yes you have to work outside the 40+ hours you get paid to do. I understand that and I support you in that. Like I said ‚Äì all I was asking for were a few sparse messages and for us to have a dialogue. It was only that which made me upset.

The Cherry Blossom pageant is great. The fact that you‚Äôre doing it, that you get to take courses and all of that. The volunteering is great and you should not stop doing it. Heck you made some friends doing it too. 12+ extra hours is fine! I know that moving forward I‚Äôll get busier too with school and all that of course. So this whole away thing just really affected me this past week cause I‚Äôve had nothing else interesting to do really. 

At the signing, if you will be queen you have to be there or traveling through out the world maybe until 2019/20. And that‚Äôs also fine. If want US to work then we make due and plan accordingly. You‚Äôre right ‚Äì us being apart is an unescapable scenario as of right now since I am finishing my education which you know, in fact will be done fairly soon. 

‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt want to live here ‚Äì believe me‚Ä¶ etc‚Äù Yeah. But I also said I‚Äôd of course be willing to make that sacrifice if things actually start moving forward for you in your job and what you do. I mean we both agreed on that it‚Äôs ultimately more than worth it for me to move there if you got things going on over there. I will be fresh, new and have nothing but my degree. It‚Äôs literally a ‚Äòfresh start‚Äô moment for me where I take that first step. There are jobs there. Jobs that I am interested in and would do. There are also jobs that I can take that can be remote. That‚Äôs one of the benefits of my area of expertise ‚Äì it‚Äôs usually all done through computers and remote work is possible. It seems as if though things are taking off for you there and we should both embrace that right? If you still want to be with me and have a future with me then we have to start planning this as soon as possible. But all of it can only happen if we‚Äôre on the same page and if we communicate with each other. 

And yes that is overwhelming. It‚Äôs tough. It‚Äôs a lot of work. But that‚Äôs life really :/ (I really hate that phrase but realistically that is the life we live). It sucks. But it‚Äôs also great because we have so many opportunities. This is what I mean about reevaluating. Seeing where we stand and what we want. Being clear about it. Are you willing to work with me on this?  It‚Äôs all about our willingness to get things to happen and ensuring they do.
8/28/17, 21:59 - Melani Carri√©: Isn‚Äôt that sad though? That ‚Äúa few sparse messages‚Äù and you ‚Äúgetting busier with school‚Äù are the two things that will apparently make this easier for you? Being too busy to talk to each other isn‚Äôt a good thing. And I don‚Äôt think I can deal with that for another year, or two years, or more. 

You‚Äôre saying ‚Äòthat‚Äôs fine‚Äô to everything that I talked about in my previous message, but it‚Äôs not. Every time you‚Äôve come here, and the few times we‚Äôve discussed what comes next, you‚Äôve made it clear that you don‚Äôt want to stay here. And I don‚Äôt want to take on the responsibility of being the tether and sole reason for you moving to a place you wouldn‚Äôt live on your own. Do you know how much pressure that places on me? And you and I both know that there are little to no opportunities here that will help you realize your full potential within your field. There just isn‚Äôt the market for it. And I don‚Äôt want to be blamed or resented for things not happening quickly enough for you. (I‚Äôm not saying that will happen, but there‚Äôs a chance.)

It‚Äôs just been such a rocky time for both of us over the past 6 months. And I feel like every time we get over a hill, there‚Äôs another, bigger one that comes so quickly after. Haven‚Äôt you noticed it too? With everything going on, there‚Äôs just been so much to think about, so many variables to consider. I don‚Äôt know.
8/28/17, 22:22 - Victor Kesten: No but I meant throughout the day! I mean realistically ‚Äì there will be times where we can talk normally. Like we have before. Of course there will be. What I meant with me getting busier with school is that time will fly by faster for me too. And then it‚Äôs always nice to come home and relax and talk to you. Of course being too busy to talk to each other isn‚Äôt a good thing ‚Äì that‚Äôs not what I meant. I mean we just experienced an extremity of you being suuuuuper busy. You won‚Äôt have to deal with it for another year. Or two. Or more. If we work together, right?
I think every time I‚Äôve come to you I‚Äôve made it clear that if I were to stay there, we try not to stay at your grandma‚Äôs house and that you had enough reason TO stay there. Right? - Just like I explained. There is no responsibility for you to take on by making me move there. There shouldn‚Äôt be any pressure. There should just be relief. It‚Äôs a sacrifice I am willing to make because I love you and because I want to be with you. Because I treasure you. There may be few opportunities that will help me realize the FULL potential of my career but I am also ONLY 22. Right? I have my whole LIFE ahead of me. Most people my age here haven‚Äôt even started Uni yet. It‚Äôs sort of an anomaly that I am so young and almost done with my Masters. And like you said yourself ‚Äì You wouldn‚Äôt wanna stay there forever either? I mean you‚Äôve always talked about getting your Masters eventually too. And all of that‚Ä¶ I mean a couple of years in Hawaii is not bad at all. Especially since I‚Äôll be with you. And hey ‚Äì maybe I‚Äôll end up loving it. Who knows? You won‚Äôt ever be blamed or resented for any of that. We‚Äôre still so young and I want to experience things in life. I want to LIVE a little. So when it all comes down to it isn‚Äôt really a problem for me. At all. Also I think that if I were to live there, I would adapt of course. And I would adapt whatever immediate surrounding I have to whatever would make it better. It would just be something new, strange and.. well exciting I guess!
Every time we get over a hill of course there‚Äôs another one! I mean there always will be ‚Äì even if we were in the same place. There always will be in general for whoever you are. That‚Äôs also one of the finer things in life. If everything was always perfect and fine, things just would not be interesting. Of course there are many variables to consider and things to think about. But right now things in our lives are more stable than ever, aren‚Äôt they? Everything is on track, realistically. We‚Äôre the conductors and the ones who decide which direction to take! Embracing all the good things and opportunities that the road will present us but also deal with all the negatives that might appear. 
I wrote you a letter actually. On Sunday. I sent it today so you won‚Äôt get it for a few days I guess. But one of the things I wrote in there is that I actually might be able to come visit you in October already if you want! I have 10 days with no class. And also I am booking my Hawaii flight for the 14th of December so I can be there for your birthday! We need small little goals like this to look forward to. I believe in us. I believe in you.
8/28/17, 22:22 - Victor Kesten: Sorry paragraph spacing got all messed up.
8/28/17, 22:23 - Victor Kesten: I am gonna go to bed now. I'm exhausted so yeah. I will speak to you tomorrow.
8/28/17, 22:23 - Victor Kesten: I really hope you have a good dat
8/28/17, 22:23 - Victor Kesten: day*
8/28/17, 22:23 - Victor Kesten: I love you a lot.
8/28/17, 22:24 - Victor Kesten: And I know things could work out perfectly. Just gotta keep working towards it and staying strong!
8/28/17, 22:57 - Victor Kesten: Well I can't really sleep. :/ but I hope you're doing well
8/29/17, 00:03 - Victor Kesten: I've been looking at jobs on Ohau for IT and software tech. There is a lot of different options. Some of them are military related though and I can't unfortunately apply to that since I'm not a US Citizen. But there are a bunch of private sector jobs too
8/29/17, 01:20 - Melani Carri√©: I think part of the reason why we're both bored and unsatisfied is because we've gotten comfortable knowing there is still someone at home if we have nothing going on. It's allowed us to become complacent, both in finding things to do and in making friends. I don't like not being able to go places without feeling guilty because you're waiting for me to become available online. That is no way to live. And you keep saying that you're fine with everything, but you're not. You get angry and passive aggressive because I can't make time for you, but that's what happens when you utilize each day as much as you can, and you're not in the same place as the other person. 

Everything you're saying is in an ideal situation. There is no way you can promise that you will not be resentful of things, and saying that "you will make the sacrifice" is not a good thing. Yes, you're only 22, I am only 23, which is exactly why we shouldn't be making decisions in our lives dependent on another person, when, if we look at things objectively, the best things we can possibly achieve are not along the same trajectory. 

Our hills are always huge. It is not normal for people to never argue, that's true, but it's also not normal for them to fight all the time, so early into a relationship. It just takes so long to get over them and move past them, that it's too draining. 

I just feel like we are forcing something because we wish we were in a different situation/circumstance, and/or that we feel like we need to continue because we've already put X amount of time in to it. I don't know.

Please know that I hear everything that you're saying, and that I care about you so much, but I think I just need a break to figure this out for myself.
8/29/17, 04:33 - Victor Kesten: We‚Äôre bored and unsatisfied not because we know there is always gonna be someone at home if nothing is going on. It‚Äôs because we feel as if though we‚Äôre living in hiatus, waiting for the next step. This is why I wanted to now talk about the next step. That we finally put an end to this nonsensical waiting and so that we can create a solid plan that both of us can follow and be happy with. You‚Äôre right. Waiting for ‚Äúanother year. Or two. Or more‚Äù is unreasonable. There needs to be an end point. And it needs to be defined with clear goals in mind. That way things become more clear and there is something to look forward to and plan for. Yeah. I know you can‚Äôt make time for someone if you utilize the day as much as you can when you don‚Äôt live in the same place. It‚Äôs I mean.. one of the sad things about this LDR. That you need to make that extra little time for the other person in order to stay sane. Right? 

 I am fine with moving there without being angry or passive aggressive. Obviously. I got upset realistically not because we weren‚Äôt talking but because we kind of became stagnant for a bit. Everything I was saying earlier is of course the ideal situation. But when you work hard towards something, the end result you expect is usually what you‚Äôre gonna get. Making the sacrifice is a good thing. It‚Äôs not even so much making a sacrifice‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs just trying something new. One should not be afraid to try new things. This goal that I‚Äôve talked about is not even that difficult to achieve. It really isn‚Äôt. But it requires our minds to be synced up. I know you‚Äôre the biggest pessimist out there‚Ä¶ and I am ultimately the biggest optimist in comparison. But I am also always right when it comes to these pessimistic/optimistic situations. You know I am. 

‚ÄúWe shouldn‚Äôt make decisions in our lives dependent on another person‚Äù. Why not? I would for you and only you because I believe in you. Because I fell in love with you. Because I want to shape my life with yours and be with you. That is not something I am saying because I am ‚Äúyoung‚Äù and ignorant. It‚Äôs something I am saying because it‚Äôs true. The best things we can achieve ARE along the same trajectory. My full potentials CAN be realized when I am with you! Because life is more than numbers and jobs and all that. It‚Äôs about creating happy moments and memories with people you love. It‚Äôs about being together with friends and family. It‚Äôs about creating family. Don‚Äôt get me wrong‚Ä¶ having a good job and self fulfillment is very important along the way. But ultimately if that‚Äôs only what you chose then you might find life very disappointing in the end. If we were to always look at everything objectively, nothing unexpected or unwanted would ever happen. Sometimes you just need to follow your heart. And you know what ‚Äì if it doesn‚Äôt work out after that, then at least you tried and saw things through until the end. There are always going to be jobs and opportunities available elsewhere. They will never disappear. But there is only one you. And if I didn‚Äôt work my butt off to end up with you then I could never forgive myself. I don‚Äôt want to live with regrets like that.

But we don‚Äôt always fight all the time‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt understand what you‚Äôre saying. We really don‚Äôt. I mean we sometimes bicker and sometimes have bigger arguments. But that‚Äôs just what people do. Getting over fights is draining though ‚Äì you are correct. It always is. But I think it‚Äôs time to build a tunnel through the biggest hill of them all. By looking at the future and planning.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre forcing something because we wish we were in a different situation and we feel like we need to continue because we‚Äôve already put X amount of time into it.‚Äù Of course we wish the situation was better. That‚Äôs what we have been working towards all along! A better situation. It‚Äôs the reason why we decided to do this in the first place. The reason why we‚Äôre continuing is because we have always been working towards that one end goal ‚Äì the one of ending up together. It‚Äôs not because we‚Äôve already put X amount of time into it. I am continuing because I believe in our end goals. Because I know everything will be fine. Because when we met up for the first time in March back in 2016, the first time you came, I knew that you were someone special. Someone so unique and well-fit into my life that I would do what it takes to make sure I end up with her. We just need to define that end goal now. And be on the same page.

To keep me sane, I sometimes read other people‚Äôs LDR stories. About how and why they met, what happened and why they try so hard. What they do to keep at it and how they feel throughout the process. The best part is what happens at the end of the road for almost all of them. The final ‚Äòreunion‚Äô step. The part where they say ‚ÄúToday my ldr ended. From today onwards we‚Äôre not leaving each other‚Äôs side.‚Äù Non of them are happy fairy tales though. Everyone has had their share of problems and concerns. But what they had in common was on clear goal. In the end to be together. 

Okay I understand you might want some time to think about this. I mean it is a lot. It really is. But I think, using your words, it is time to stop forcing something because we wish we were in a different situation/circumstance. It‚Äôs time to do something about it. To stop wishing and to start making it real. To really knock it out of the park and work towards a better future. We‚Äôre so close now.

Ultimately what I wanna say is that yes ‚Äì we do work EXTRA hard to get this to work. We are working on it because we KNOW that a future together would be incredible. It really would be. It‚Äôs what both of us have been dreaming about since the start. Don‚Äôt lose that vision. I know this is what you want to. I know it. You know it. Our timeframe right now is me being able to visit you in October. I‚Äôm gonna be there again in December, for almost a month. I then return here to start my thesis ‚Äì a research paper in which I can do a lot off from home realistically. Which means I can work from Hawaii, being with you. We can not only spend so much time together in the coming short time, but then also so so very soon finally be done with it. Finally be free from this long distance thing.
8/29/17, 09:16 - Victor Kesten: Take your time reading this. I have more written that I will probably send later today. I'm not gonna bombard you with messages since I know you said you needed a bit of space to think things through. Just these two long ones. Just wait for it too.
8/29/17, 11:58 - Victor Kesten: People graduate college at 21. People graduate college at 25. There are people that have children and are single. People get married and wait 8-10 years before having children. There are people who are in relationships who love another, there are people who love each other who are not together. Hell there are people waiting to be loved or even to find love. My point is everything in life happens according to our own clock. One may look at friends or coworkers or whatever and see that some are ‚Äòahead‚Äô or even ‚Äòbehind‚Äô you. But they are living their life according to the pace of their own clock. You decide what your steps are, what you should do and what to spend time on. 

Harrison Ford didn‚Äôt become an actor until he was 30. J.K Rowling didn‚Äôt write Harry Potter until she was 31. The McDonalds guy didn‚Äôt start McDonalds until he was 52. Life has no smooth roads for any of us. When we go down a road we need to remember that happiness is a talent we develop ‚Äì not an object we seek. It‚Äôs the ability to bounce back from life‚Äôs inevitable challenges. You grow every day and learn new things every day.  

Something that might be worth trying is that Instead of saying ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have time‚Äù try saying ‚Äúit‚Äôs not a priority‚Äù and see how it feels. For everything in life. Often that‚Äôs a perfectly adequate example of how twisted our minds can sometimes get. It‚Äôs like.. ‚ÄúI have time to go to the gym. I just don‚Äôt want to.‚Äù But if we look at it from another perspective it‚Äôs ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt prioritize the gym because I have other things to do.‚Äù It‚Äôs the same thing with something your grandma would say right. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to go to the doctor because I don‚Äôt have time‚Äù. If she were to say it like ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to go to the doctor because my health is not a priority‚Äù and started thinking that way, maybe she would change. Changing our language and the way we perceive things reminds us that time is a choice. If we don‚Äôt like how we‚Äôre spending an hour, we can choose differently. We always have options. Especially people like you and me. We have to value and treasure the time we have on this earth. 

In life, it‚Äôs not dying that frightens us. It‚Äôs living without ever having done our best to achieve our dreams. It‚Äôs living, at an old age, with regrets and fears. A ship in the harbor is safe. But that‚Äôs not what ships are for. I read some good advice on the internet a few years ago that really stuck with me. When I‚Äôm scared to tackle an obstacle or to face a life challenge I close my eyes and pretend I‚Äôm an 80 year old man who regrets not tackling all the obstacles he wanted to in life. Then when I feel like that old man, I say to myself, ‚ÄúI wish I was young again‚Äù. Then I open up my eyes and Voila! I‚Äôm young again. It‚Äôs when you‚Äôre young that you can take these risks. It‚Äôs the time when you‚Äôre strong and free to embrace whatever the world might bring you. The world brought me you. And the world brought you me. 

Right now in the face of hopelessness, which I have a feeling you‚Äôre currently feeling, there is little sense in not at least trying to accomplish what your heart and mind desires. You‚Äôre one of the strongest people I know. If anyone can do it, you can. Leo Tolstoy wrote that we cannot prevent birds from flying over our heads, but we can keep them from making nests on top of our heads. Similarly, bad thoughts sometimes appear in our mind, but we can choose whether we allow them to live there - to create a nest for themselves and to breed. 

You know, nothing diminishes anxiety faster than action. Which is why I was so upfront about creating that plan in my last message. A plan for action. A plan which will lead us in the right direction. Something that we can work towards and do together! If someone offers you an amazing opportunity but you are not sure you can do it, say yes. Then learn later how to do it. Learn on the road. Learn while doing. Leaving ones comfort zone and norm is what makes us stronger and better. There is a simple realization from which all personal improvement and growth emerges. This is the realization that we, individually, are responsible for everything in our lives, no matter the external circumstances. We of course can‚Äôt always control what happens to us, but we always control how we interpret what happens to us as well as how we respond. You turn disadvantages into advantages and learning experiences.

In eight months ‚Äì yes only eight months ‚Äì I will be done with uni. In May of 2018. Already in the beginning of October, one month from now, I can come visit you again. We can be together for a few weeks. Once again in December I will be back and I can be there for almost a month. Then during spring I want to the latest be there when the Cherry Blossom festival happens in March. To see you win and to support you. And yes of course you will be busy during those periods, but I will at least be there with you and we can do things when you‚Äôre not busy. I can go around with you at work and we can fall asleep together. 

And you know ‚Äì I can even look at thesis opportunities in Hawaii. It‚Äôs not impossible. That would prepone my arrival to you in December/January. I actually had something in mind that was real estate, machine learning and visualization related ‚Äì topics that I am SUPER interested in and have specialized in. Sometimes you gotta make your own opportunities! Now that I am thinking more about it, I actually see it as something very reasonable and fun. Hell I know exactly the professor who can supervise me for such a project. That would reduce the time we‚Äôre apart to.. less than three months. And if I come visit in October ‚Äì even less.  It‚Äôs actually ingenious for our situation and I‚Äôm surprised why I haven‚Äôt thought about it before. So huh ‚Äì how about it. 3 months? Sorry I was doing research within this and thinking about it as I typed this paragraph. But essentially it‚Äôs highly plausible that this is something I could do and would enjoy doing AND would be within my field of study and interest. And be with you while also fulfilling my dreams. It‚Äôs actually pretty perfect. This is something we should discuss more.

I was gonna leave it as a surprise until I got it but I am in the process of getting my drivers license right now so that you don‚Äôt have to drive all the time when we‚Äôre together. To offload some stress from you. Also now with the money I‚Äôve earned I can afford to buy you nice things and take you to nice places. It was really the only reason why I took the job during the course. So I could get you nice things and to come see you. 

Yes you will be busy. But we can work around that! I mean you‚Äôll be driving a ton, like usual! And we can call during those periods of time. I‚Äôm pretty bad at saying I want to call, but god damn I love hearing your voice and talking to you. You best believe I‚Äôll be calling you every damn day. I think that‚Äôs a pretty good solution as of right now since you‚Äôll have so much to do IRL. I was already planning to, before we started talking about all this, to start sending you letters and cards again. I mean like I said ‚Äì I sent one on Sunday. I am so committed to this princess. To make this work and to make our dreams come true. 

And I suppose that one of the important things right now is not to get mad or angry or upset. I guess I was wrong for being so. It‚Äôs to instead find ways to make things work and to become better! To think of solutions, like I did earlier, and to think of things to move forward. Not to give up!  

Realistically the jobs I am after later in life require work experience within the field. You have to start somewhere. Getting work experience from working in Hawaii while you‚Äôre doing the same is ideal. https://www.cnbc.com/2017/08/18/these-millennials-spend-their-days-on-the-beach-and-still-make-money-heres-how.html This link is actually super interesting and shows one of the options I can do if I don‚Äôt find something physical there. Like I said. When I am done with uni it‚Äôs a fresh start for me. I can do whatever and go wherever I want and clearly Hawaii is calling me. I will always have my degree to fall back on elsewhere and people to pick me up if things fall through. So do you. But we need to live a little and take risks! To be with you is a dream of mine and I will ensure it becomes reality. If I do my thesis in Hawaii it‚Äôs also a step into that market and area which means it will be easier for me to probably get a job there in the future too! While being there for my thesis I can scout places and all of that. It‚Äôs only positive. 

You know, stress isn‚Äôt bad. If Steve Jobs hadn‚Äôt been stressed about delivering the perfect iMac or Bill Gates making Windows OS, the computer revolution would not have happened. What‚Äôs bad is letting stress make your life miserable. You have to embrace the stress and make the stress your bitch! Some day we will all die. But all the other days we will not. And we gotta embrace those days!

But ultimately of course it all comes down to how you yourself feel and think. I can only preach so much about all this. But know that I am 100% willing to work with you to make this work and for us both to be happy! It‚Äôs really all laid out so clearly in my mind. The clarity is what keeps me going. I take our dreams and thoughts about our future and lay them out. I see every time I get to visit as the most exciting thing! I see the end goal of being there with you right in front of me and I know what I have to do in order to make that happen. Because I believe you‚Äôre worth it. You‚Äôre worth all the effort. You‚Äôre worth the heartache that happens at times, and most important of all - you‚Äôre worth doing my best for.
8/29/17, 13:13 - Victor Kesten: But really. Take your time to think about it all. You need to think about what you want and if you're willing to wait the potential three months if we do that. Realistically that's the hardest part. The waiting. Everything else floats on in your life only I'll be there with you. In my eyes it's more than worth it and I have complete faith in us. In you. We're strong enough to make it past this last path. It's sometimes all a Rollercoaster of emotions. I know. But with this solution there is a clear light at the end of the tunnel. A short tunnel in this scenario. I will give you space and the time you need. When you're ready for whatever it is you want, let me know.
8/29/17, 19:35 - Melani Carri√©: I don‚Äôt have time to reply to all of this in full this morning, so I‚Äôm just going to send something brief before I head out for work. 

The fact that you started all of these messages by saying ‚Äúwe‚Äôre bored and unsatisfied not because we know there is always gonna be someone at home if nothing is going on. It‚Äôs because we feel as if though we‚Äôre living in hiatus‚Äù, essentially telling me that what I said I was feeling was wrong, and that instead I was feeling something else, makes me think that you‚Äôre not really listening to what I‚Äôm saying. 

I am not feeling hopeless. I am feeling overwhelmed and confused with what I want. And that you keep pushing for ‚Äúconcrete plans‚Äù does not make me feel better. You‚Äôre basically telling me that my concerns aren‚Äôt really concerns, and that it‚Äôs just because I ‚Äòstruggle‚Äô to deal with us not having a ‚Äòset plan‚Äô. That is not the case. 

I do not want to make plans like that for something I am unsure of. The last thing I told you was that I needed a break to think things through for myself, and instead of just letting me do that, you are telling me why I am wrong to feel the way I feel. 

I know, it‚Äôs impossible to fully explain one‚Äôs inner workings to an outsider, but everything that you‚Äôre sending me, random stuff about people having kids and getting married, and Harrison Ford, and you coming here in October and December and February is not making me feel better. When I say that I need a break from us to figure out what I want, that‚Äôs what I mean. At the very least if you don‚Äôt understand, I would like you to respect that.
8/29/17, 20:33 - Victor Kesten: You don‚Äôt need to reply to it all in full. I just wanted to share my thoughts and my feelings. The first message was also like 4AM so Idk if it all was coherent.

I didn‚Äôt mean for it to come out as me telling you how you were feeling is wrong and that you were feeling something else. You shouldn‚Äôt interpret it as that. I am listening to what you are saying. 

You‚Äôre feeling overwhelmed and confused with what you want. Okay. I understand. I thought giving a concrete plan of what was possible in terms of our relationship could help you see things more clearly and perhaps enlighten your situation. That telling you about other things and giving anecdotes would perhaps help. Your concerns are of course real concerns and I heard and understand them. Struggling with not having a set plan is not the case. My plan was only aiming to alleviate the long distance situation and to solve the communication problems. For us to finally start living normally together. That I could be there in December and stay there since I have a plan for the future. That we can finally build that life together, with friends and family all around. That I could visit in October to make things easier. To reassure you that a future together is more than likely if we‚Äôre both on board. But I guess I see that this goes beyond that.  

You‚Äôre right though. We should not make plans for something you are unsure of. You are not wrong in feeling the way you feel. I mean I said in my last paragraph that it of course ultimately comes down to how you think and feel. That you must know for yourself - what you want and what you want to prioritize in life. You and I both know that a relationship requires communication and prioritization of each other. That it goes beyond normal means and requires certain... not sacrifices, as it‚Äôs such a negative word. But rather radical risks and tough commitments that at the end of the day are ultimately worth it. Or they should be anyways.  

Of course you can have your break from us. I understand and I respect that. It of course makes me sad. But you‚Äôre right in that you need to find yourself and figure out what you want. And whenever you know or are ready to talk ‚Äì let me know and we‚Äôll go from there.
8/31/17, 23:34 - Melani Carri√©: I know this is probably the last thing you want to concern yourself with, but are you still working on the website? Courtney and Ted have been asking about it, and I can't send any links to the hosting company/search engine company for them to start their work until everything on the Vesta site has been done and updated. 

Let me know - thank you.
8/31/17, 23:34 - Melani Carri√©: I hope school has been going well
9/1/17, 02:38 - Victor Kesten: No yeah. Of course. I'll do some tweaking in the morning and update it. Let me know if you see anything that needs fixing
9/1/17, 02:39 - Victor Kesten: I hope you're doing okay.
9/1/17, 09:46 - Melani Carri√©: Ok awesome, thank you
9/1/17, 09:46 - Melani Carri√©: I'm doing fine
9/1/17, 09:47 - Melani Carri√©: Not sure how to begin addressing any of the issues that we've been tabling for the time being.
9/1/17, 09:47 - Melani Carri√©: Either way, I'll go over the site in the morning and see how it looks. I'm sure once its fully updated it'll be great.
9/1/17, 10:12 - Victor Kesten: Yeah definitely. It'll look great. I think what I have left from the list is resizing the list icons. Struggling a bit with it but working on different solutions. Then there is one scalability issue that occurs when using different size screens. And then the contact page - making message box bigger like you requested.
9/1/17, 10:18 - Victor Kesten: It's okay. I really meant it when I said take your time. I want to work with you on addressing everything of course. But it's also important we both have time to reflect on everything individually first. 

By the end of next week - Sunday or so, I'm gonna send you something by mail. I hope that it's okay I do so and that it doesn't violate anything. If it does, then let me know and I'll hold off. But know that I'm taking this time very seriously and that it's been a wake up call to some extents.
9/1/17, 10:18 - Victor Kesten: Anyways. I know you have a long weekend ahead. Hopefully haha. Go and have some fun!
9/1/17, 10:19 - Victor Kesten: Ill send you a summary email of the website updates and what the search engine requirements are. Along with hosting
9/2/17, 16:38 - Victor Kesten: Melani. I see you've deleted all of our photos on Instagram and Facebook. Please don't tell me I'm doing all of this in vain right now.
9/2/17, 19:31 - Melani Carri√©: I didn't delete them, they're archived, so they're still there. But being on a break means seeing how you feel with and without the other person, that includes seeing their face all over your social media does it not? I don't understand what you mean by 'doing this all in vain'.
9/2/17, 19:33 - Victor Kesten: Okay. No I understand
9/2/17, 19:33 - Victor Kesten: I'm sorry.
9/2/17, 19:33 - Victor Kesten: I just freaked out for a little bit. I'm sure you understand that I'm feeling stressed.
9/2/17, 19:34 - Victor Kesten: Now I know.
9/2/17, 19:34 - Melani Carri√©: Surely you also understand that a break also means figuring out whether or not the relationship is working anymore, and how you feel about it
9/2/17, 19:34 - Victor Kesten: Definitely
9/2/17, 19:35 - Melani Carri√©: Then I don't understand why you're saying doing this all in vain
9/2/17, 19:35 - Melani Carri√©: When either is a possibility
9/2/17, 19:35 - Melani Carri√©: To stay together or to break up
9/2/17, 19:36 - Victor Kesten: I said that cause I freaked out. That I just assumed the worst.
9/2/17, 19:36 - Victor Kesten: I'm sorry. Please - continue your day
9/2/17, 19:37 - Victor Kesten: Just know I am thinking about you. A lot.
9/2/17, 19:37 - Melani Carri√©: I mean. I don't know when we should discuss this.
9/2/17, 19:38 - Melani Carri√©: Because we can keep this break going for a long time, but regardless, it's going to be at the back of our minds.
9/2/17, 19:38 - Victor Kesten: Like I said to you - I will send you something by the end out next week if that's okay.
9/2/17, 19:39 - Victor Kesten: What I think we both should feel is
9/2/17, 19:39 - Victor Kesten: A clearer picture of
9/2/17, 19:39 - Victor Kesten: What's wrong
9/2/17, 19:39 - Victor Kesten: And what we want to happen
9/2/17, 19:39 - Melani Carri√©: Okay
9/2/17, 19:39 - Melani Carri√©: So do you want to start?
9/2/17, 19:41 - Victor Kesten: Right now
9/2/17, 19:41 - Victor Kesten: ?
9/2/17, 19:42 - Melani Carri√©: I don't know. Do you really want to wait to address this at the end of next week?
9/2/17, 19:43 - Victor Kesten: No I don't
9/2/17, 19:43 - Victor Kesten: I want it addressed as soon as possible
9/2/17, 19:44 - Victor Kesten: Do you have time?
9/2/17, 19:45 - Melani Carri√©: I have some time, but I have to leave for showings in Waianae at 10:30 so I have to start getting ready around 8:30/8:45
9/2/17, 19:45 - Melani Carri√©: and I'm going to a play this evening so I won't be home tonight. We can do this tomorrow morning if you would prefer
9/2/17, 19:46 - Victor Kesten: Yeah let's do this tomorrow morning. If you are okay with this. For you. So Sunday night for me? Sunday morning for you?
9/2/17, 19:47 - Victor Kesten: This allows me to write some thoughts down and prepare.
9/2/17, 19:47 - Victor Kesten: Is that alright?
9/2/17, 19:48 - Melani Carri√©: Yeah thats fine
9/2/17, 19:49 - Victor Kesten: Okay thank you.
9/2/17, 19:49 - Victor Kesten: I'll talk to you tomorrow then.
9/2/17, 19:49 - Victor Kesten: I hope you have a good day
9/2/17, 19:54 - Melani Carri√©: You too
9/2/17, 19:54 - Melani Carri√©: Have a good evening
9/3/17, 14:36 - Victor Kesten: So I have written a longer message to preface everything. I think maybe it's good to read all of that before we talk. It's essentially my thoughts and reflection on this break
9/3/17, 14:38 - Victor Kesten: But ultimately I want us to discuss - which I do make clear in the message. That it's a discussion between us
9/3/17, 14:57 - Victor Kesten: It's in no way a lecture or me telling you how to feel. It's part of my self reflection
9/3/17, 15:22 - Victor Kesten: So yeah. It's not something that needs responding too. Only a discussion there afterwards I guess
9/3/17, 19:15 - Melani Carri√©: Ok
9/3/17, 19:16 - Victor Kesten: The reason why I said next weekend was cause I wanted to give you enough space and time before interfering. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever been this anxious about anything. It feels like I haven‚Äôt had a proper night‚Äôs sleep for I don‚Äôt know how long. When I sit and try to focus on things, I get restless leg syndrome ‚Äì classic sign of anxiety and stress, and I can‚Äôt stop thinking about the situation at hand. It of course comes and goes. But it‚Äôs... yeah. It‚Äôs all had an impact for sure. What is the worst part, however, is the fear of not knowing what might come next. Of not being in sync with you, like we normally are. But I still think this break has done me very good. It‚Äôs allowed for some serious reflection. I mean ultimately the feelings I described above are a testament to how much you mean to me. How much us means to me. But this‚Ä¶ experience has really been a wakeup call. 

I don‚Äôt know how you have felt over the time that has passed. I mean hopefully you‚Äôve had time to think and to reflect. That you found some way to start processing things. Maybe you need even more time, which of course ‚Äì you can have. I want you to be certain about how you feel. 

This message won‚Äôt be filled with anecdotes or anything else intended to make you feel worse about anything as you said the last message did :/. I‚Äôm really sorry about that. This however, is just straight from my head and heart and the things I have had time to think about since we last spoke. Frankly, it‚Äôs me being more vulnerable than I ever have before.

Our relationship has always been serious. Since day 1. Our plan was always that I would finish uni while you work, we move together wherever the world may lead us and then we go from there. We‚Äôve had to deal with the distance and to climb certain hills. But every damn time, we conquered them and come out better. We truly have. We‚Äôve over the years worked together and become an amazing team. I will never find anyone like you. I fell for you the moment we started talking. I fell so hard for you. And what‚Äôs nice is that I have also never been love blinded due to the distance. It‚Äôs always been real. So surreal real. And I know you felt that for me too. When I met your parents for the first time, I remember you told me that they said they‚Äôd never seen you act like that in front of anyone before. That they could tell there was something special between us.

Do we fight sometimes? Yeah. Of course. Sometimes it‚Äôs over trivial stuff that‚Äôs meaningless in the long run. I mean in a relationship you can‚Äôt let those type of fights effect you that hard. You just can‚Äôt or it‚Äôll ultimately become the end of you. But I know that it‚Äôs way easier said than done. When I say ‚Äòyou‚Äô, I mean a generic ‚Äòyou. Not a you, you. But realistically ‚Äì every little thing will have some impact whether you want it to or not. I think we need to be better at communicating during these fights. I know I do at least. We cannot let them drag on either. That‚Äôs also a problem :/. Fights however, happen because there is passion. 

I want to bring up an example of the only argument we had since I left back for Sweden. It‚Äôs about the gas cards and how I was insisting on that you are paying too much and all that. I mean realistically the only reason I brought that up and was so insistent on it was because I care about you and I want you to be treated right and fair :/. Not because I wanted to argue and make you feel dumb or whatever. I was only trying to help. Now of course ‚Äì I probably handled it poorly as well by not stopping after you asked for a change of subject, an area where I must improve on, but it‚Äôs an example of a fight that‚Äôs happened because of love and care.  

Don‚Äôt get me wrong, there are of course times when I might have moments of concerns or doubts with us too. And I mean both of us can live without each other. But I then always think big picture and remember that everything is in fact fine. I think about all that you bring to my life. The happiness, the memories, the pure excitement for the future. Through it all, you‚Äôre the greatest addition to my life that makes it more exciting and better. 

But here. I am actually gonna be super straight with you. My passive aggressiveness is actually really fucking dumb. I hate it. I hate myself for it. And I know you hate it more than anything. I‚Äôm so fucking done with it. Finding the root to a problem is what allows you to fix and move past it.  I need to face my fears. One of my issues before was that I would have a hard time talking and saying how I felt during fights. I think that issue is gone, for the most part, but perhaps as a successor the passive aggressiveness came in as the perpetrator. I think the root of the problem for me is confrontation and feeling like I am the victim. But of course ‚Äì I am not always the victim. What I realize is that sometimes have to let go of the pride and just admit when you‚Äôre in the wrong. I actually had a document where after we would‚Äôve had a fight I just let loose and write down whatever I was feeling. It would be sort of a release for me to calm down or whatever. But the problem with it, which I realize now, is that you were still affected by whatever we had talked about and I never shared my post-mortem thoughts. 

One thing that we have lacked that has most likely hurt us is the lack of evaluation and reflection. The lack of communication when it comes to how we feel about certain things and what we want to see happen. We were so good at this when we started dating. There perhaps has been too much bottling up ‚Äì something that‚Äôs always dangerous. Because that‚Äôs when you can get into situations like this. Like exactly like this. I‚Äôd love for you to talk to me about what is on your mind. What you‚Äôre thinking. And for me to do so back to you. Not so that I can tell you that you‚Äôre wrong‚Ä¶ God no. But only so that we together can work it out. Because that‚Äôs what I ultimately want. To work this out‚Ä¶ To come out stronger and better. 

You know the comfort thing you were talking about in your last message? That at the end of the day you‚Äôre comfortable coming home knowing the other person is there. I thought about that a lot. Isn‚Äôt that what love is though? To be in a LDR poses many challenges. It really requires you to a certain extent to always communicate and prioritize each other. To be selfless, to think of things to reassure the other person. Always saying good morning, always saying good night. Having date nights or game nights. Communicating face to face. Making the choice to choose them every single day. That they‚Äôre worth it. Occasionally choosing them over people and realizing that it isn‚Äôt a phone or computer you‚Äôre talking to. You‚Äôre talking to YOUR person. It‚Äôs about choosing to love them. Choosing to deal with all of the pain and tough feelings of missing them because you know it will be worth it the minute you are in the same room. 

BUT it also needs to be healthy. And this is the most important part in my opinion. We need to be able to live our own lives and not dwell on the fact that we cannot physically be together. One also must give each other space. Constantly texting and wanting to Skype or call for three hours a night and getting angry when they don‚Äôt reply is not healthy. I mean we don‚Äôt have that same time as we did back when we started dating. The 5000+ word messages and all that. One also needs to live your own life while also living a life together. You might say these two paragraphs contradict each other. But they don‚Äôt. They work in perfect harmony, right? I mean both apply for LDR and a ‚Äòclose‚Äô relationship. And this is where the guilt aspect comes into play. Ideally, one shouldn‚Äôt feel guilty for not being able to talk during certain hours. It‚Äôs better to feel excitement to tell the other person what you‚Äôve done afterwards or to later see the person. That this person, at the end of the day, is the person you want to be with. This is not me lecturing you or anything. Like hell no. This is me reflecting on the issue, teaching myself and just sharing my thoughts. You may of course agree or disagree. 

I think reconnecting with my friends here the other week was great. I mean it‚Äôs always great to hang out with friends and what not. Having the social aspect every once in a while. Your new friends ‚Äì I‚Äôm sure are also great, right? I would never ask you to give up a social life. Never. It‚Äôs so important. I‚Äôm so glad that you‚Äôve found friends there. Like I was saying earlier, it‚Äôs important to live your own life while you live your life together with someone else too. For example ‚Äì my friends here, they have ‚Äúguys nights‚Äù where they hang out and let their significant others do their own things with their friends. And yet other times, they can also come along or they themselves go along with their significant other to see their friends. That‚Äôs healthy I think.

I believe that the key things for a happy life and feeling good is a combination of healthy eating, regular exercise, drinking lots of water, responsible finance planning, fulfilling career, active romance, a strong social life and also sensible amounts of sleep. Of course ‚Äì balancing all of these things is SO difficult and sometimes we have to prioritize one or the other. Especially when you‚Äôre working 40+ hours per week, and in your case have to do all this volunteer work + Cherry Blossom stuff AS WELL as trying to get your own clients. I commend you for being so god damn hard working. It‚Äôs very inspiring! But it‚Äôs at least what everyone should strive for. 

I‚Äôm lucky. I‚Äôm lucky because I have time to go on endless walks and reflect on life and my choices. I‚Äôm lucky because every day I can acknowledge and contemplate what I did good, what I did wrong and what I can do better the next day. I walked 30km the other day. There was so much to process and think about. I‚Äôm lucky because I found someone that was so similar to me in so many ways and that she wanted to join me on my journeys. I‚Äôm lucky I‚Äôm in love with my best friend. Do you remember sending me that song? And the others. Like Echo, Need You Now and Two Is Better Than One. I mean there is some truth to those songs. I never told you this ‚Äì but I started a recording of Echo that I never finished. Well it‚Äôs semi-finished. But I wasn‚Äôt happy with it. I wanted something perfect for you. But I want to finish it and deliver. 

For a year and a half, although technically we spent the first half year together pretty much every day, we‚Äôve been apart. We were about to reach the point where that journey ended. We still can reach that point. Do you know how excited I got when I realized I could actually do my thesis in Hawaii? It‚Äôs so soon. I saw it as an opportunity to not only be with you in person, but also to help you with things. To be the boyfriend you want and deserve. To reduce your stress during this super busy time and to make you happier. To cook for you, to help you keep things clean and do laundry, to motivate you and to help you around while also being able to do my own thing. So that we could go on dates ‚Äì true dates since I‚Äôll get a lot of money for being offshore, meet new people, so you can have time for writing again or even recording music, for us to make friends and for us to also at the end of the day sleep next to each other. For us to laugh, to have fun and to learn together. Not to be a burden, but your second half. Your support and love. 

Everything is easier as a team. Did you know that hugs and physical contact with someone else reduces stress levels and makes you a happier person? Cuddle therapy. Maybe it‚Äôs silly. But I still dream of spending the rest of my days with you. I dream about our future and how amazing it is that our core life values align so well. How amazing of a person you are. I dream about the day we can live together. I dream about doing all the cute things together. I dream about our wedding. Hell, I even know exactly which engagement ring to get you. 

For me it‚Äôs always been about the people I love in life the most. They are the ones that deserve my attention, thoughts and my care. I‚Äôve told you that since day 1. These people are my family, you, perhaps a few select friends. And now during later days ‚Äì your family too of course. They‚Äôre lovely and I‚Äôve come to get to know them super well and really enjoy spending time with them alongside you. We‚Äôve created so many memories together and I can‚Äôt wait to see them again. 

This Christmas I was going to surprise you with so many things. I was definitely going to book my flight to be there on your birthday. That was the first surprise. I actually even already bought presents for you. And everyone else in your family too. I wanted to be as prepared as I could be as to not.. well, disappoint you. I hate disappointing you. It‚Äôs the worst feeling ever. I want to be the best for you. I am awful at presents but I am certain these will be good as I have had so much time to think and plan it. 

And you know, if this is the time to be super serious and honest then here we go: I of course had an entire proposing thing planned for Christmas as well. When everyone we hold close is there. So that we could celebrate it all together and rejoice over happy times. Your parents and family being there. My family being there. All together. For our family‚Äôs to meet and for us all to enjoy the moment. To spend Christmas and new years together. It‚Äôs what we‚Äôve dreamed for right? And now that I have the opportunity to stay with you from December onwards, it would be perfect. Really perfect. My plan was, and I mean obviously still is, to also really really stick to the gym this time. And running. I‚Äôm already seeing results and I can‚Äôt wait to surprise you honestly. I want to look SO good for you. Especially if I were to propose to you. I mean I am even keeping away from beer and will continue to do so in moderation. It‚Äôs not like I am spoiling a surprise here as it really is the experience and moment it would happen that‚Äôs important. Plus - I know you don‚Äôt like surprises. But that‚Äôs the plan. 

Now of course I know you can‚Äôt be married and do the cherry blossom festival. But you can surely be engaged and right after it‚Äôs all done, go do what your heart wants. I mean in my mind I picture us standing on or in front of a beach, in Hawaii, getting married with the people we love all around us. Happier than we‚Äôve ever been. 

But once again of course, I am getting way ahead of myself. Once again I was planning for something uncertain. So please don‚Äôt feel pressured by those plans or anything. It‚Äôs just things going on in MY head. I mean ultimately you need to decide what you want to do. All I want to say with this is that I realize we‚Äôve had some problems but that those problems should be dealt with in an appropriate way by communicating more clearly, by taking a step back and adjusting accordingly. That I myself realize and know how I can be even better for you. How I can truly make you feel like the woman you deserve to be. That I also want to have this dialogue with you. 

I drew a series of pictures that I was gonna send to you by mail. As of right now they‚Äôre not done but I have a photograph of them. So I can send that I guess, if you want to see it. We‚Äôve talked so much about our future. About what we want to do and how we want to live it. About all the great things that will happen and how amazing it will be! I hope a few of these can embody that spirit. Now I‚Äôve never drawn anything for you before.. cause I‚Äôm frankly an awful artist. Ironic really. I work with visualizations, computer graphics and UX design but I‚Äôm bad at drawing. Anyways - I spent a lot of time on these and I hope you‚Äôll like them for what they are. Let me know if you want to see them and the text associated to them. It‚Äôs a drawing of you and me at Disney World, a drawing of you and me in our future garden and a drawing of us travelling the world together. 

What I want to say with these pictures and words is that there is so much in the future to look forward to for us. And it‚Äôs not even the far future ‚Äì these are things that can happen soon. And I want to do them with you. I want to treat you like the princess you are. I want to do all the nice things for you. I want to go paint mugs with you, take you on cute dates and take you to Disney World ‚Äì your favourite place. 

I really believe you should give us a shot princess. I think we‚Äôre both worth that given how we‚Äôve felt and how close we are to reaching the end of the most difficult part about the relationship ‚Äì the distance. We can work past the issues we‚Äôve had and ultimately end up happier than ever. You know that‚Äôs the case. I think we‚Äôre both worth living out our dreams of being together while at the same time achieving our other life dreams. I think we‚Äôre both worth learning from each other and only becoming better. And I think you and I make the greatest team. A team that can overcome pretty much anything. 

I personally believe that we hold on to each other, not because ‚Äúso much time has passed‚Äù like you said in your previous message, but because of what we‚Äôve always believed in. Our love for each other. It‚Äôs what has kept us through this the entire time. Our love has been so incredibly strong. And I really don‚Äôt believe it can fail us now either. It‚Äôs not because we‚Äôre so ‚Äòyoung‚Äô either. I mean hell, you turn 24 in just 3 months. My parents were already married when they were 24 and had me ‚Äì their first child. I‚Äôm just so certain that you‚Äôre the one for me. That you‚Äôre it.

And I want you to know that if we do continue this, then I want to do this seriously. All of it. Like we‚Äôve always said we would. It‚Äôs not like we haven‚Äôt been ‚Äòserious‚Äô before. I‚Äôm just saying I want to take the next step with you. To have a better and clearer mindset ‚Äì something I‚Äôve really gained from this break. And I know it‚Äôs maybe a bit scary to think about. That it‚Äôs perhaps the most intimidating thing. I know at one point all of this wasn‚Äôt scary to think about for you. It isn‚Äôt for me at all. It‚Äôs only the right thing. Know that I am going to be there with you, by your side, the entire way. And because of this, I need you to be extra sure. Be sure that you‚Äôre willing to work with me, learn with me and evolve with me. I know actions speak louder than words. So let me show you. 

I just wanted you to know how in love I am with you and how much you matter to me. And because you matter this much to me, I am willing to do what it takes. This was to let you know what I have gotten out of this break so far. What I have come to realize about myself and our situation. And just‚Ä¶ yeah. I love you Melani. I really do. That‚Äôs the bottom line. I mean this has even become more than love. You‚Äôre the sun in my life. You are IT for me. My soulmate. I told you that before and I truly meant it. I still mean it. Please don‚Äôt give this up. We‚Äôre worth more than that. 

I don‚Äôt need you to reply with a long message to this. I can‚Äôt find the right words to say how committed I am. I really can‚Äôt. I just‚Ä¶ I want to make this work with you.
9/3/17, 19:54 - Victor Kesten: Sorry. I know it became a lot. Would you like to see one of the drawings?
9/3/17, 19:56 - Melani Carri√©: I am writing a message back
9/3/17, 19:56 - Melani Carri√©: Partial message
9/3/17, 19:56 - Victor Kesten: Ok
9/3/17, 19:56 - Melani Carri√©: I have most of it done.
9/3/17, 19:56 - Melani Carri√©: The message you sent was filled with a lot of ‚ÄúI will‚Äùs, ‚ÄúI believe‚Äùs, and a bunch of ideas about changing that are only coming to you now. It‚Äôs nice in theory, but there is nothing you can really change about the kind of person you are. 

The fights we get in to, they happen more often than you are remembering, because fundamentally we have different approaches to things and are different people. 

The fact that we are in this position, and only now are you actually listening to me or taking me seriously doesn‚Äôt make me feel better. Things like fighting, how we communicate, your passive-aggressiveness, not really planning romantic things for us to do, going to the gym, spending time with your friends, these are all things that I have tried to talk to you about, persistently, over the last year, and you never gave them any noticeable thought. It‚Äôs come to the point where I am so tired of even getting into those discussions with you, that, whether or not you say you‚Äôre going to do it, I don‚Äôt expect anything anymore. 

Yes, the beginning of our relationship was great, but we spent that January from July together, and afterwards, everything went downhill really quickly. If you recall, we almost broke up that December. 

Even when we‚Äôre together, after not having seen each other for so long, we STILL always find ways to get pissed off with one another. My father made the good point that us never seeing each other should mean we never/rarely get into arguments when we do. I don‚Äôt remember that happening even once. 

The comfort thing can go one of two ways: the way you said where it‚Äôs love that makes you feel better, and then the other where it‚Äôs a safety net that allows complacency, procrastination, and laziness. 

There are a lot of things I have been keeping to myself over this past year (believe it or not, despite how much I talk), and because things never changed or were never addressed properly, I just started to feel taken for granted. One thing this week has done for me is highlight that I‚Äôm torn between feeling guilty about this because you are one of the closest people to me in my life, whilst simultaneously feeling free because I didn‚Äôt have the weight of our relationship on my shoulders. 

I‚Äôm just defeated. I don‚Äôt know how better to say it. You say that the last thing you want to do is disappoint me, and while there have never been huge, singular incidents of that, when there are multiple small things, they snowball and fester. 

I just can‚Äôt go back into this full force the way you want me to without lying to myself, and that breaks my heart. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs simply a temporary feeling because of everything that‚Äôs happened, or if it‚Äôs definitive, but I don‚Äôt want to lie to you about that.
9/3/17, 20:02 - Victor Kesten: Okay I'm writing a reply too.
9/3/17, 20:13 - Victor Kesten: Yeah. I know there were a lot of ‚ÄúI will‚Äù and ‚ÄúI believe‚Äù. I mean like I said - I had a lot of time to think and evaluate things. This time.. has been invaluable. Something I promise I will NEVER need again. 

Yeah it‚Äôs dumb that I am only taking this as seriously as I should have right now. It is so fucking dumb. And I this is one of the points I have thought a lot about as well. But trust me. It‚Äôs stuck with me. I‚Äôm a learning person. We both are. And I‚Äôve learnt so freaking much from this. 

Yeah we did almost break up that December. But do you remember how everything became fine when we actually saw each other in person? When we were together? 

No I remember a lot the fights. All of them. I just brought up one of the examples. But yeah. And most of them have been petty really. But they do add up. And yes. The comfortness ‚Äì I agree with what you say. Definitely. Taking someone for granted is unacceptable. 

Like I said ‚Äì I will prove to you that what I am saying is reality. That what I am saying is true and will happen. Of course you were free from this because of the ‚Äúweight‚Äù of our relationship was gone. But I am telling you now that this ‚Äúweight‚Äù won‚Äôt even be there to begin with from now on. I promise this. 

You say you‚Äôre defeated and that you cannot go back into full force into this. Can we do this then, in small steps? Can I impress you and surprise you? Prove to you that what I am saying is serious. Can I prove to you that what you are feeling is only a temporary feeling and that it‚Äôs not definite. Can you give me this second chance? Give me the opportunity to life your spirits and to make all the good things happen? Like I said ‚Äì I think we‚Äôre both worth that based on how we‚Äôve felt. I‚Äôm glad you‚Äôre not lying about this. Like I said ‚Äì we need conversations about this.
9/3/17, 20:13 - Victor Kesten: Let my actions speak louder than words
9/3/17, 20:13 - Victor Kesten: Like i said - I am so incredibly committed and have had so many realizations.
9/3/17, 20:14 - Victor Kesten: IMG-20170903-WA0017.jpg (file attached)
Here is a teaser picture of one of the drawings.
9/3/17, 20:15 - Victor Kesten: I understand what you're feeling though. And I know I can make you feel different
9/3/17, 20:29 - Melani Carri√©: Asking for me to trust that things will change after your actions have proven the opposite is like wondering why your bank doesn‚Äôt loan you money anymore since you‚Äôve shown you can‚Äôt pay it back. 

I honestly don‚Äôt know if I can go back into this even with small steps. At least not right now. It‚Äôs just too much, and like I said, I‚Äôve gotten to the point where I just don‚Äôt have it in me anymore. To feel freed from weight and pressure and stress and unhappiness is not what should have happened if things were destined to look up once we went on a break. For you, you realized all the things you should have been doing; for me, I realized just how much everything has affected me. 

This isn‚Äôt a sudden realization either. I have been feeling this way for a while. Even before I went to Sweden, and while you were here. (If you remember asking me if I was going to break up with you at your grandparents house. I said no, when I was considering yes.). I didn‚Äôt say anything sooner because it was easier to just see if things would change with time‚Ä¶ But they didn‚Äôt. And having been vocal about my issues, to still see little to nothing change, meant that it didn‚Äôt mean enough to you to do it on your own, probably because you figured you were safe in the relationship. I could be wrong, but either way, that‚Äôs just not okay with me, and I don‚Äôt think I can move past that right now.
9/3/17, 20:39 - Victor Kesten: Like I said ‚Äì I needed this wake up call. I wish you would‚Äôve brought it up this seriously more sooner, but I am truly sorry it had to happen this way. I truly am. It‚Äôs god awful that it did, but that‚Äôs what was clearly what was required. But it‚Äôs done SO much for me. And it‚Äôs clearly done a lot for you too. 

Believe me when I say this will change. You know me. You know that when I put my mind to something, I do it to the best of my abilities. 

What we‚Äôve both realized is the same thing though ‚Äì like you said. 

I know it‚Äôs not a sudden realization. And I have been thinking about it too ‚Äì all of it. I mean like I said even before we got into this last week. This autumn would be different. Things were gonna change with time. I knew that after my visit to you in Hawaii, things would have to be different for us to last. I was preparing SO hard. 

Melani. This will be different. You don‚Äôt need to be anymore vocal about it. Trust me. Trust me like you trusted me when we met. Things will look up after this break. I never strived into the ‚ÄúI‚Äôm in a safe relationship.‚Äù I think I have been close. But never fully. Because I know you would never accept that. I myself would never accept that. I understand you can‚Äôt move past it all right now though, but it‚Äôs why I am saying we can do this in small steps. I know how to prove to you that this is different. You were talking about a loan from the bank with the payback ‚Äì well I have lots to offer already.
9/3/17, 20:40 - Victor Kesten: I know you have it in you. I believe
9/3/17, 20:42 - Victor Kesten: Give me this chance to make everything real
9/3/17, 20:43 - Victor Kesten: Use my energy for this
9/3/17, 20:45 - Victor Kesten: I think everyone deserves a second chance. And it's with what they do with that chance in what decides what happens
9/3/17, 20:45 - Victor Kesten: I'm so ready for this
9/3/17, 20:46 - Victor Kesten: No one is perfect. I've clearly fucked up a ton. But what's different about this is that I realize my fuck ups. I know exactly how to do things differently. And I know how to make you proud. How to make you feel true
9/3/17, 20:46 - Victor Kesten: And this is why I am asking for this second chance.
9/3/17, 20:46 - Victor Kesten: If I were half-assing it, I wouldn't.
9/3/17, 20:46 - Victor Kesten: Like I said - I am not gonna disappoint you.
9/3/17, 20:46 - Victor Kesten: You're worth too fucking much to me
9/3/17, 20:49 - Victor Kesten: I know you can find the energy in your heart to give me this chance
9/3/17, 20:51 - Melani Carri√©: I‚Äôm sorry. I just can‚Äôt. 

I care about you so much, and you‚Äôre so important to me, but I feel like I‚Äôve already given plenty of chances, and you telling me that ‚ÄúI have it in me‚Äù and ‚Äúcan find the energy‚Äù to give another one makes me feel like you‚Äôre, again, not actually listening to what I‚Äôm saying. The damage has already been done.
9/3/17, 20:52 - Victor Kesten: Please
9/3/17, 20:52 - Victor Kesten: Let me repair the damage
9/3/17, 20:52 - Victor Kesten: This is the first explicit chance dear
9/3/17, 20:53 - Victor Kesten: It's the only chance I will need
9/3/17, 20:53 - Victor Kesten: I am listening to what y ou are saying
9/3/17, 20:53 - Victor Kesten: Let me prove to you
9/3/17, 20:53 - Victor Kesten: That this will be the best hting ever
9/3/17, 20:54 - Victor Kesten: If you say you care and that I am important, then trust me on this. Trust me with this chance
9/3/17, 20:54 - Victor Kesten: Read everything I said.
9/3/17, 20:56 - Victor Kesten: We're worth this real second chance
9/3/17, 20:56 - Melani Carri√©: That is so unfair of you to say that. To say that if I truly cared about you then I would put myself back into a situation where I wasn‚Äôt happy. 

The sad fact of the matter is I don‚Äôt trust that things are going to change. I have read through everything you said, and I remember you saying stuff like that before. I can‚Äôt move past it. It's been affecting me for too long.
9/3/17, 20:57 - Victor Kesten: No. But that's just it - it won't be a situation where you are unhappy. You won't be unhappy. Because things WILL change. Why would I fuck up a second chance like that?
9/3/17, 20:58 - Victor Kesten: I am asking you TO trust me that htings will change
9/3/17, 20:58 - Victor Kesten: Because of what you said - that you care and that I am important to you.
9/3/17, 20:58 - Victor Kesten: to give me this one shot blind trust.
9/3/17, 20:59 - Victor Kesten: That you will be happier than ever before
9/3/17, 20:59 - Melani Carri√©: "Why would I fuck up a second chance like that" - Why would you fuck up a relationship like that in the first place? You can‚Äôt guarantee anything. With everything I have going on over the next year, I need to protect myself and put myself first. Which is why I can‚Äôt do this. Please just listen to what I‚Äôm saying.
9/3/17, 21:01 - Victor Kesten: Because I was stupid. I've done many stupid things. I'm asking for the chance because I know it can be different. That I CAN guarantee. I understand you need to put yourself first over the year - and I told you that us together can work easily with that.
9/3/17, 21:01 - Victor Kesten: I just... I don't know. I just can't accept that you would give up on us just like that. Not after all that we've been through. Not after all we've felt.
9/3/17, 21:01 - Victor Kesten: I at least thought you would have given me this second chance.
9/3/17, 21:01 - Victor Kesten: A chance to prove to you
9/3/17, 21:01 - Victor Kesten: that it can all work
9/3/17, 21:03 - Victor Kesten: That you're it for me. My everything.
9/3/17, 21:03 - Victor Kesten: That you would give me this chance to prove myself because of that..
9/3/17, 21:03 - Victor Kesten: Because you've felt so too in the past.
9/3/17, 21:04 - Victor Kesten: My soulmate.
9/3/17, 21:05 - Melani Carri√©: It‚Äôs not giving up. It‚Äôs understanding what I need and want for myself and my own sanity.
9/3/17, 21:06 - Melani Carri√©: One of my friends said that if people are meant to be together, they always find their way back to each other in the end. Maybe that‚Äôs the case, and we are supposed to be together. But right now, I just don‚Äôt feel that way.
9/3/17, 21:07 - Melani Carri√©: I'm sorry.
9/3/17, 21:07 - Melani Carri√©: This is so difficult to actually put in to words.
9/3/17, 21:07 - Victor Kesten: Okay.
9/3/17, 21:08 - Melani Carri√©: I don't want you to confuse this with me not caring about you. Because I do. So much. But... I can't continue on like this.
9/3/17, 21:09 - Victor Kesten: Okay.
9/3/17, 21:09 - Victor Kesten: But
9/3/17, 21:09 - Victor Kesten: I have one request
9/3/17, 21:09 - Victor Kesten: Please don't delete me from your life.
9/3/17, 21:09 - Victor Kesten: Don't remove me from facebook or instagram.
9/3/17, 21:09 - Victor Kesten: Or anything else.
9/3/17, 21:09 - Melani Carri√©: That is the last thing I want.
9/3/17, 21:10 - Melani Carri√©: The absolute last thing I want to happen, is that we're not in each other's lives.
9/3/17, 21:10 - Victor Kesten: And this - I still want to be your friend. To be one of your closest friends.
9/3/17, 21:10 - Victor Kesten: And at least on my side, I will always love you. And I would wait an eternity for you.
9/3/17, 21:10 - Victor Kesten: So if you evre do find that part back. The energy
9/3/17, 21:11 - Victor Kesten: Then you know that I am waiting.
9/3/17, 21:11 - Victor Kesten: But okay.
9/3/17, 21:11 - Victor Kesten: I understand you
9/3/17, 21:11 - Victor Kesten: And I don't want you to be in pain from this
9/3/17, 21:12 - Melani Carri√©: If it makes you feel any better, I am crying - this wasn't an easy conversation to have.
9/3/17, 21:12 - Victor Kesten: I am crying.
9/3/17, 21:12 - Victor Kesten: I have never cried over anyone but you.
9/3/17, 21:12 - Melani Carri√©: But you're one of my best friends.
9/3/17, 21:12 - Melani Carri√©: So I would never cut you from my life.
9/3/17, 21:12 - Victor Kesten: That makes me glad. it really does
9/3/17, 21:13 - Melani Carri√©: I'm so sorry.
9/3/17, 21:13 - Victor Kesten: Don't be. This isn't on you.
9/3/17, 21:13 - Victor Kesten: This is my fault.
9/3/17, 21:14 - Melani Carri√©: It happens to the best of people. Relationships are hard.
9/3/17, 21:14 - Victor Kesten: It's just... I don't know. I can't believe myself. That's all.
9/3/17, 21:16 - Victor Kesten: Just... yeah. Don't forget. Don't forget that I love you. So much. That I still believe you're my soulmate and my second half. That if you ever feel the spark again... that I am here waiting for you. And if you don't, that's okay too. It's for the best I suppose.
9/3/17, 21:18 - Victor Kesten: I can never give that up. And I'm sorry for that I guess. Sorry for myself. Sorry for you. I don't know. Like I said. I've fallen for you so... incredibly hard. And this.
9/3/17, 21:18 - Victor Kesten: I can't find words.
9/3/17, 21:18 - Victor Kesten: I'm sorry.
9/3/17, 21:18 - Victor Kesten: But thank you for being my best friend. For still being that after all this.
9/3/17, 21:19 - Melani Carri√©: I can't find words either. I'm just thankful that you are in my life.
9/3/17, 21:19 - Melani Carri√©: And I hope you know this wasn't easy.
9/3/17, 21:20 - Melani Carri√©: I don't know how much time you'll need between this and us talking again. But I respect your space and wishes.
9/3/17, 21:22 - Victor Kesten: I know it wasn't easy. If it were easy you would've done it earlier.
9/3/17, 21:22 - Victor Kesten: I don't know what I need right now.
9/3/17, 21:22 - Victor Kesten: I don't really know anything anymore.
9/3/17, 21:23 - Victor Kesten: I've never been this lost.
9/3/17, 21:24 - Melani Carri√©: I understand
9/3/17, 21:25 - Victor Kesten: I hope that it's okay that we still talk. As often as possible. Or whatever time/life allows.
9/3/17, 21:27 - Melani Carri√©: Of course
9/3/17, 21:28 - Victor Kesten: I am gonna head off for a bit. I think I just need the rest of the night to... process things
9/3/17, 21:29 - Melani Carri√©: Okay
9/3/17, 21:29 - Melani Carri√©: That sounds like a good idea.
9/3/17, 21:29 - Melani Carri√©: I'll be doing that too
9/3/17, 21:30 - Victor Kesten: Okay
9/3/17, 21:30 - Victor Kesten: Well. I think I will message you tomorrow though. If that is ok.
9/3/17, 21:31 - Victor Kesten: I hope you have a good day
9/3/17, 21:31 - Victor Kesten: Goodnight
9/3/17, 21:31 - Melani Carri√©: Okay, yes that's okay
9/3/17, 21:31 - Melani Carri√©: Goodnight
9/4/17, 07:13 - Victor Kesten: Hey. I'm just wondering. You didn't find someone else eight?
9/4/17, 07:15 - Victor Kesten: Right*
9/4/17, 09:03 - Victor Kesten: Sorry. Maybe that's a really stupid question
9/4/17, 09:05 - Melani Carri√©: What do you mean "did I find someone else"?
9/4/17, 09:05 - Melani Carri√©: I'm at my friend P≈ç'ai's performance right now
9/4/17, 09:05 - Melani Carri√©: Sorry if replies are slow
9/4/17, 09:05 - Victor Kesten: No no - please. If you are busy then do your thing. It's okay. I just meant someone else you like. That you want to date
9/4/17, 10:44 - Victor Kesten: Another guy
9/4/17, 11:04 - Victor Kesten: I know you might be tired or busy or whichever. But please just answer me that one question
9/4/17, 11:39 - Melani Carri√©: I have no immediate plans to jump into anything. Why?
9/4/17, 11:40 - Victor Kesten: I mean my question was if there was another guy you were interested in
9/4/17, 11:46 - Victor Kesten: I know its frank and straight up. But I just want the truth
9/4/17, 12:15 - Victor Kesten: The reason why I'm asking is because I am trying to process everything. To cope. To piece the puzzle in my mind together.
9/4/17, 14:18 - Victor Kesten: If yes, ok. If no, ok. I just need to hear all the truths.
9/4/17, 21:10 - Melani Carri√©: Sorry, I fell asleep last night. I've been exhausted all the time lately. 

No, I am not dating anyone right now. Why is knowing this going to help you move on?
9/4/17, 21:17 - Victor Kesten: I mean.. I said if there is another guy you're interested in. 

It's okay. It seems like you've been up to a million activities and that's great. I'm glad you've finally found your place there.
9/4/17, 21:31 - Victor Kesten: To me there's a difference there. And it just sounds like you're avoiding the question :/
9/4/17, 21:35 - Melani Carri√©: Oh my god. No. I am not dating, or seeing, or interested in anyone.
9/4/17, 21:38 - Victor Kesten: Okay. Sorry!! Like I said.. It's just a ton going on in my head. That's it though. I'm done with questions about it.
9/4/17, 21:39 - Victor Kesten: I trust you fully
9/4/17, 21:39 - Victor Kesten: And understand
9/4/17, 21:48 - Melani Carri√©: Obviously not if you're going to ask me 4 times. I don't know why you would even want to know, unless you're thinking "she must have left for someone else" instead of listening to the actual reasons I gave yesterday, when we discussed this for hours at length.
9/4/17, 21:48 - Melani Carri√©: But whatever.
9/4/17, 21:49 - Melani Carri√©: We don't have to talk about this anymore.
9/4/17, 21:51 - Victor Kesten: No. Like I said - I just.. I just need to know every detail. Every whatever quirk or not quirk. To piece together the puzzle. 

I want to know because it does make a difference. I know and heard you yesterday - why you don't want to do this anymore. But this was just a question I had to explicitly ask.
9/4/17, 21:52 - Victor Kesten: I don't want to drag this on
9/4/17, 21:52 - Victor Kesten: I really don't.
9/4/17, 21:52 - Victor Kesten: Like I said. I want to be friends. You are my best friend. And that's what you'll remain to be
9/4/17, 21:54 - Victor Kesten: I mean hell. You could've left me for someone else along with the other reasons
9/4/17, 22:01 - Melani Carri√©: It's not a puzzle. I gave you specific reasons why. If it was a puzzle, it would've been vague and confusing. And honestly, whether or not I decide to go out with someone, or see someone, isn't something you should be asking about until this whole thing as settled, if at all.
9/4/17, 22:03 - Victor Kesten: Okay. It's not a puzzle. But it's still something I need to process. No I know it's not something that actually has to do with me. But I am asking you now, would you tell me if that is the case?
9/4/17, 22:04 - Victor Kesten: Or when/if it happens
9/4/17, 22:07 - Victor Kesten: I am asking if you can do me that justice
9/4/17, 22:08 - Victor Kesten: There is no specific reason why. Not that you should concern yourself with anyways... I mean if it comes to that then why would you. It's just for my own well being.
9/4/17, 22:13 - Melani Carri√©: That is really unfair of you to ask me that.
9/4/17, 22:13 - Melani Carri√©: And you phrasing it as "Doing you a justice" means that you're making me out to be the villain in all of this.
9/4/17, 22:13 - Victor Kesten: You're not the villain
9/4/17, 22:13 - Victor Kesten: I am just asking you for that favour
9/4/17, 22:14 - Victor Kesten: Why is it unfair
9/4/17, 22:17 - Victor Kesten: I am just asking you to be straight and hoenst with me if that happens
9/4/17, 22:19 - Melani Carri√©: It's not a favor
9/4/17, 22:19 - Melani Carri√©: That's not the definition of a favor
9/4/17, 22:20 - Melani Carri√©: I don't understand why it matters, unless the only reason you want to stay friends with me is because you're waiting for me to change my mind.
9/4/17, 22:22 - Victor Kesten: I am staying friends with you because despite everything, you've become one of the closest people in my life. I've also told you that I love you regardless of what happens. The reason I am asking for this 'favor' is because it allows me to brace myself. To deal with it appropriately. To get time to live on. That's why  I am asking you for that favor
9/4/17, 22:24 - Victor Kesten: If I were only to stay friends with because i were waiting for you to change your mind I'd give up. Whteher or not you ever change your mind is a timeless question. It's clearly not something I can decide as I've already said I'd give you the world to do so.
9/4/17, 22:24 - Victor Kesten: This is just a favor I am asking for my own sanity.
9/4/17, 22:28 - Melani Carri√©: If I ever start seeing someone seriously enough that it becomes public, then I can give you a heads up. But I still don't think it's fair of you to ask me that. And it makes me think that you need time away from me.
9/4/17, 22:28 - Melani Carri√©: If it's going to cause that many problems.
9/4/17, 22:29 - Melani Carri√©: Which I would understand, but I can't be self-aware for the both of us.
9/5/17, 06:12 - Victor Kesten: Ok that's fine
9/5/17, 07:09 - Victor Kesten: Like I said. I don't want to argue or fight. Just process
9/5/17, 09:01 - Victor Kesten: It‚Äôs just. Yeah. The guy in your snapchats ‚Äì it‚Äôs just nothing? All the activities you‚Äôve done. I know it‚Äôs not my business anymore. But I told you. I just need to know
9/5/17, 09:02 - Victor Kesten: It won't cause any problem. And I don't need time away
9/5/17, 09:02 - Victor Kesten: You don't need to be self-aware for the both of us
9/5/17, 09:09 - Victor Kesten: No sorry. I trust that you would tell me. Like I said ‚Äì I don‚Äôt want to dwell on this. I hope you had fun today.
9/5/17, 10:12 - Victor Kesten: https://imgur.com/ZqUOEMD
9/5/17, 10:12 - Victor Kesten: Which one are you üòÇ
9/5/17, 10:34 - Victor Kesten: Also this was a thing the other day
9/5/17, 10:34 - Victor Kesten: http://i.imgur.com/iBcIWPn.png
9/5/17, 10:34 - Victor Kesten: Since it was the day Harry's kids went off on the Hogwarts Express
9/5/17, 10:35 - Victor Kesten: the last day mentioned in the books
9/5/17, 10:35 - Victor Kesten: 19 years later
9/5/17, 10:50 - Victor Kesten: This is just the last thing I want to mention in regards to us. I realize now that I have to finish what I have going on here. With my uni and the life here. I mean I‚Äôve told you before that I preferably don‚Äôt want to live here after I am done. That still stands. But I do have to finish this properly. And also that you have to do whatever it is you have put your mind to do over there. You do have a lot going on over there and it‚Äôs important you put yourself first for that ‚Äì like you said. However, regardless of this worst case outcome, I‚Äôm still going to prove to you that what I said about change is real. That I am still going to work on self-improvement and being better. And even though we‚Äôre not together anymore I know I can still be better for you too.  

I still love you. And I still know you‚Äôre my soulmate. My other half. There is no question about it. And that‚Äôs okay. So if you ever do find the energy, the willpower, the spark I guess ‚Äì to try again. Then you tell me. Even if it‚Äôs just with small steps. Tell me and we could at least talk about possibilities. It‚Äôs obvious we do need to be realistic too though in regards to what‚Äôs possible. But yeah. Don‚Äôt be afraid. It could be next week. It could be next month. In a year. Or never. And I guess that‚Äôs okay too. But I am gonna live by the statement ‚ÄúIf people are meant to be together, they always find their way back to each other in the end.‚Äù. I live by it because it‚Äôs what I believe in honestly. It‚Äôs what my heart tells me. The reason why I do however still want to stay friends, is not because of I‚Äôm ‚Äòwaiting‚Äô for you to change your mind. It‚Äôs because of exactly what you said when we did break up. That I too am thankful you‚Äôre in my life ‚Äì that the last thing I want to happen is that we‚Äôre not in each other‚Äôs life. We have made such a big impact on each other and to just give that connection up feels wrong. 

But yeah. Our conversations moving forward shouldn‚Äôt be about stuff like this. It should be friend stuff. Best friend stuff, right? I mean ‚Äì can you still be my best friend? I understand if not. But I would still really like that.
9/5/17, 12:52 - Melani Carri√©: By saying "if you ever find the energy, willpower, spark - to try again", you haven't heard and accepted what I said. And by saying that you're living by the philosophy of "people who are meant together find their ways back to each other", it means that you are waiting for me to "see the light" or whatever you think should happen with regards to us.
9/5/17, 12:53 - Melani Carri√©: We can't jump directly into the plan of "being best friends" until you've fully understood the shift in dynamic.
9/5/17, 12:53 - Melani Carri√©: If I start liking someone else, or dating someone else. "Best friends" never demand that kind of knowledge.
9/5/17, 12:53 - Melani Carri√©: They never say "I NEED to know, so do me a favor and a justice and tell me".
9/5/17, 12:54 - Melani Carri√©: So the way I see it, you either have to take a break from talking to me, so that you can fully process what has happened, as is your right, or you need to stop demanding things from me that, as you said so yourself, are no longer relevant to you.
9/5/17, 13:00 - Victor Kesten: Well. I based that on what you said ‚Äì you don‚Äôt feel that way right now. That you‚Äôve gotten to the point where you don‚Äôt have it in you anymore. I understand that. But things changes ‚Äì feelings change. I mean who knows. That‚Äôs where I base my belief.
9/5/17, 13:01 - Victor Kesten: I know what has happened. And what you said. And right now I am not demanding anything from you
9/5/17, 13:01 - Victor Kesten: realistically I am just telling you the truth. How I feel. And then asking you if you still want to be my best friend.
9/5/17, 13:05 - Melani Carri√©: Yes. That I don't feel that way anymore. I didn't say I had gotten to the point where I "don't have it in me", I said "I can't do this". Those are two different sentiments. And you saying "feelings change" isn't understanding what has now happened. 

"The guy in your snapchats - it's just nothing? All the activities you've done. I know it's not my business anymore. But I told you. I just need to know." <-- that's demanding information from me that is not relevant to you.
9/5/17, 13:06 - Melani Carri√©: Also, both related and unrelated, are you going to change your cover photo on facebook? Or are you keeping it the same.
9/5/17, 13:07 - Melani Carri√©: Is it really friendship if one of the people is waiting for things to change? Of course I want to stay friends, but you're making it complicated, and I think it's because you're trying to normalize things too soon.
9/5/17, 13:09 - Victor Kesten: " like I said, I‚Äôve gotten to the point where I just don‚Äôt have it in me anymore." You did say that. You also did say "I can't do this right now." Always with the "right now" afterwards. I do understand what has happened. And like I also said - regardless of that I will still hold onto what you said and improve accordingly. That it's important to me to prove to you I can. Doesn't matter if it "works" or not realistically. I just don't want to let you down. 

Yes. I know. You don't have to tell me. And I mean by the looks of it you seem really happy and to be doing lots of great things. That'
9/5/17, 13:09 - Victor Kesten: 's great
9/5/17, 13:10 - Victor Kesten: I won't demand that information.
9/5/17, 13:10 - Victor Kesten: You can choose to keep it to yourself.
9/5/17, 13:10 - Victor Kesten: I can change my photo for you.
9/5/17, 13:11 - Victor Kesten: Well we are in a complicated situation. I believe in change. You don't I guess. And that's fine. I think we can have friendship. But yeah maybe I am trying to normalize things too soon
9/5/17, 13:13 - Victor Kesten: I mean it's like.. unless you're now saying you're gonna point blank move on and there will never be a chance. ever.
9/5/17, 13:14 - Victor Kesten: But I guess even you yourself can't really know that.
9/5/17, 13:20 - Victor Kesten: Look yes. What you do from now on is of course your deal and business. Who you see, how you feel, what you do. Of course. And realistically you don't 'owe' me anything. I thought you could tell me though as a friendly gesture - a favor as I am trying to heal. But if that's not ok, then fine. Of course. I'm not gonna demand that info from you
9/5/17, 13:31 - Victor Kesten: I have made the choice to wait for things to change. Is it a stupid choice? I don't know. I mean I guess it is. It's definitely not a safe 'choice'. But I never like to live 'safe'. I see the potential in this choice and that in the end, even if there is the slightest of chance, it's worth making that choice despite it being what it is. Only the future can tell what happens. I mean why do you think I am making that choice? Well because I believe in what I said. All of it. I believe that the changes we required are more than plausible. Realistically that chance of that choice being affected negatively or positively is based on the choices I make along with the choices you make. But you are free and independent to make whatever choice it is you want to make. And I am not gonna stop you making the choices you feel are right.
9/5/17, 13:32 - Victor Kesten: But I do want friendship - at least. Nothing complicated there. I won't make it complicated for you. I promise
9/5/17, 13:42 - Victor Kesten: And I don't know. Maybe me explaining all this to you is stupid. Maybe it doesn't make sense to you. Maybe you think I am crazy. But it makes sense to me.
9/5/17, 14:12 - Victor Kesten: Ultimately: Yes. You don't feel it right now. I get that. But I'm holding on to the chance that you may in the future. And the future may be or hours or years away. That, to me, is something worth waiting for. That's the bottom line and what I wanted to say with that message.
9/5/17, 14:20 - Victor Kesten: It won't affect you in any negative way. I just wanted you to know this.
9/6/17, 06:49 - Victor Kesten: I know you're very busy and that I'm not a priority anymore. But it'd be nice to get this done and move forward. Don't you agree?
9/6/17, 06:59 - Melani Carri√©: I literally just got home.
9/6/17, 07:01 - Melani Carri√©: I don't know what else you want me to say. I don't think you should be living your life trying to prove anything to me. You should be doing things that you want to do for you, and nobody else. 

I'm happy to be friends as long as you understand the situation. But to say that you're holding on to a chance at something in the future doesn't make me feel better about things. If anything, it makes things awkward.
9/6/17, 07:07 - Victor Kesten: It is for me. I am doing it for me. 

I do understand the situation. Well idk. What do you want me to feel?
9/6/17, 07:09 - Victor Kesten: Something is only awkward if you make it awkward. I'm not gonna make things awkward for you. Like I said - you do what you want to do. I would never stop you making a choice you feel is right.
9/6/17, 07:13 - Victor Kesten: I mean what it should tell you and feel is that what I felt and thought is real enough for me to hold onto it. That's it.
9/6/17, 07:13 - Victor Kesten: But I am doing things for me. As you should do things for you.
9/6/17, 07:19 - Victor Kesten: But yeah. Maybe me telling you this, like I said, is stupid. And awkward. But don't let it affect you that way, please.
9/6/17, 07:43 - Melani Carri√©: Okay
9/6/17, 07:46 - Victor Kesten: Okay good.
9/6/17, 07:47 - Victor Kesten: Thank you
9/6/17, 08:14 - Victor Kesten: We can take a few days off if that would make things better though. I don't know. But hey I'd love to hear about how work and the cherry blossom thing is going. Along with everything else.
9/6/17, 12:23 - Melani Carri√©: I don't know
9/6/17, 12:23 - Melani Carri√©: Maybe it would be better to wait a day or two
9/6/17, 12:23 - Melani Carri√©: But I can tell you about the cherry blossom more after saturday
9/6/17, 12:23 - Melani Carri√©: That is orientation day
