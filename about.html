<h2>Who am I?</h2>
My name is Victor Kesten and have a Master of Science in Engineering in Computer Science (Civilingenjörs* inom Datateknik) from Kungliga Tekniska Höskolan in Stockholm, Sweden. At an early age I moved from Sweden to Beijing, China and so I've spent most of my life living abroad, learning about foreign cultures and connecting with people all over the world. My true passions are visualizaing information, long distance running, playing the guitar and exploring the chemistry behind brewing beer.

<!--
During my first year of studies while studying I also worked multiple hours per week with MyAcademy - a tutoring company based in Stockholm. I tutored three highschool students over the course of a year in Maths, Physics, Chemistry and English. Together we managed to boost each student's grade on average from C to A in the subject we targeted.  -->

<!-- I lived in China between 2002-2013 and then later moved to Sweden to commence my University studies. Growing up in an international communitiy taught me a lot about being a world-wide learner and how to work with people from all over the world. I graduated High School at the Western Academy of Beijing in 2013 and was accepted into the "Civilingenjör"* Computer Science program at Kungliga Tekniska Högskolan in Stockholm, Sweden. I'm well experienced in teaching, programming and group leadership.
