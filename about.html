I lived in China between 2002-2013 and then later moved to Sweden to commence my University studies. Growing up in an international communitiy taught me a lot about being a world-wide learner and how to work with people from all over the world. I graduated High School at the Western Academy of Beijing in 2013 and was accepted into the "Civilingenjör"* Computer Science program at Kungliga Tekniska Högskolan in Stockholm, Sweden. 
<br><br>
I'm well experienced in teaching, app development and group leadership. 

<!-- 
During my first year of studies while studying I also worked multiple hours per week with MyAcademy - a tutoring company based in Stockholm. I tutored three highschool students over the course of a year in Maths, Physics, Chemistry and English. Together we managed to boost each student's grade on average from C to A in the subject we targeted.  -->

* Civilingenjör is equivalent to a Master of Science degree in Engineering.
