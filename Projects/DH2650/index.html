      <b><a style="font-size:120%;">John Fuller from Avalanche Studios</b></a><br>
      Hearing John Fuller talk about what it's like to work at Avalanche and the challenges they face was very interesting. Since Avalanche
      specifically focus on creating open world sandbox games, it allowed for us as students to niche our questions to that area
      and gain insight into how you perfect an entire genre. I personally thought it was very interesting when he spoke about
      what it takes into creating a large open world experience and at the same time make it not feel empty.
      <br><br>
      Although it was out of the scope of the presentation, it was very cool to hear how his journey of physics and the
      Havok engine landed him a job at Avalanche and how this journey worked. I think physics is fairly underrated within
      games engines and the amount of work that goes into it is extreme.

      This post will just be an update post on our project! Below you will find some screenshots. My task in the project
      right now before the demo is to make some sort of an enemy system within Unity. This of course comes with it's
      challenges and it is therefore unknown whether or not this will be in the demo! However, we do have a lot to show.
      Tianli has put together the 'beat' system and it is looking pretty good and I believe this is what we will show.
      Creating this enmey system has however taught me a lot about C# as a programming languages as well as how to use
      Unity in more effective ways. I believe the end result of our game will be very good once it all comes together!
      <br><br>
      Beyond this we also have awesome artwork coming in from two other team members which includes character models
      and background scenes for the gameboard! Our last team member is ensuring we stay on task and is dealing with a
      lot of the managing tasks such as GDD and documentation. All in all I believe our end product will be very good.
      <br><br>

      This is my enemy system so far. It will spawn waves and the enemies that spawn will move towards the player
      which in this case is green in the middle. What I have to do still is add projectiles that go towards the player
      and also do some cleaning and organization within the code.

      Here is the beat screen we currently have. There is also music that has the same beat as the moving/clicking mechanics!

      Reflecting on Lectures So Far

      So far we have had three guest lectures from people within the industry. Below I will write a little bit about
      each one and what impact they left on me!

    <b> <a style="font-size:120%;"> Oskar Burman from Fast Travel Games</a></b>
      <br>
      It was very interesting to hear from Oskar Burman about the potential of VR gaming in the future. He seems
      to be very optimistic about the potential market for said games and that it will only get better. Some of the key
      parts I took away from the presentation was how to divide up games into categories when looking at platforms. Although
      they were so obvious to me - hearing it listed out with graphics made me think. A phone game is usually played in short bursts
      but multiple times throughout the day. So the goal of a phone game developer is to create a game that the user can not only
      enjoy for a couple of minutes, but a game that will also bring them back at a later time. This is most likely why the cooldown
      style games are so popular these days. By this I mean games that have for example, after you perform one important thing in the game,
      you cannot perform the same action again until 8 hours later UNLESS you buy this sweet power up. This is how the game company
      earns money from the free to play genre. The goal is to find a fine balance where you give the user the option to pay or wait
      with end goal of bringing them back to play.
<br><br>
      The second category dealt with traditional games. For most people you know that when you sit down and play you generally play for
      a couple of hours or as long as you can. This works because real console and computer games are designed to be played that way
      to begin with - you expect the user to play for a longer period of time. VR now becomes the third category and this is where
      things get interesting. A VR requires, essentially, an appointment. There is a lot of setup required and generally a player
      does not play for too long as it is quiet an exhaustive experience. Oskar Burman said that a VR session is approximately 30
      minutes at a time. This may however mean that after the session is over, the user takes a bit of a break and then jumps back
      into it again after they've recovered. So designing a game that allows for this type of play is an interesting process!

<br>
        <b><a style="font-size:120%;">Jörgen Björklund from Paradox</b></a><br>
        I really enjoyed this lecture as we got to hear insights on how the publishing world works - perhaps something normal
        gamers don't think about when accusing developers for the 'misdoings' of a game. There is huge heated discussion online
        about monetization models, specifically in game lootboxes, and it was interesting to hear from Jörgen how most of the
        decisions are made as this shed some light on the situations happening in the real world (I am of course right now
        talking about Starwars Battlefront 2 by DICE and the huge controversy surrounding this). I did not know for example that
        once a publishing company agrees to a project (after much 'input' from them as to how the game should be) they OWN the
        intellectual property. Of course it makes sense to a certain extent as they are the capital venturists and want to have
        exhaustive control over the project they funded. However from a creator's perspective it must feel very weird to sell
        your idea just like that. He did discuss what happens when a publisher and developer fall through and that it does happens
        ocassionally but it's very scary to think about.

      <b><a style="font-size:120%;">Tommy Palm from Resolution Games</b></a><br>
      The presentation by Tommy Palm gave a cool insight into how mobile games are designed to be profitable and a brief history
      on what they were prior to the iPhone. It was very interesting to hear him talk about the future of VR and mobile gaming as
      well.

    This will be my individual blog for the course DH2650 Computer Game Design given at Kungliga Tekniska Högskolan. I
    together with 5 others are creating a game with the codename "2DBeat". This game is a top-down view rhythm shooter game,
    inspired by old classics such as asteroids as well as a more recent title called Crypt of the Necrodancer and Guitar
    Hero. The game will be produced in Unity and this blog intends to show the progress of the game and have posts from what
    I learn along the way!
