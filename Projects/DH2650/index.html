      This post will be a bit longer as it is a reflection on all the presentations given today, as well as a thorough final thoughts moment on
      our project!
      <br><br>
      <h2>Kamiclones</h2>
      I really enjoyed hearing about this game! I think it's cool that they created their own Java engine and including a bunch of different libraries
      beyond Unity. I know that Daniel, their main programmer, is very comfortable using Java as his main programming language and has used this
      to create previous games. So it's great to see him incorporate this knowledge into this course! The gameplay has a lot of potential and I
      could totally see this being a hit. I like ragdoll physics and the way to use 'clones' to create a path in order for you to beat the level
      is very neat.

      <h2>Arr</h2>
      I personally am not invested in this type of genre but I believe the end result of their game was very cool compared to what they previously
      showed. I know that working with AR based technology can be very difficult and therefore it's cool to see that they created a very functional
      and neat game based on just Vuforia and marker tracking. Like some of the questions/comments after their presentation said - it would be very
      cool for them to incorporate ARKit/ARCore and have markerless surfaces to really create a different sense of immersion. However, a very good
      and valiant effort on there part. I was impressed!

      <h2>BAM</h2>
      This game was a bit out of my league. I have never played Football Manager but I know of the game type. It seems that this game is very
      mechanic and strategy heavy and I honestly believe they failed to show this importance during the presentation. I also gave them a suggestion
      to show which team is which once in game, but this was appearntly an afterthought and something they didn't have time to implement. Perhaps
      not a game I would buy, but surely there is a niche market for it.

      <h2>Puzzle Tower VR</h2>
      Wow! This game was very cool to hear about and I love how they tested it on a real target group. Their primary target audience was on younger
      kids and they successfully tested it on said audience. I think the game itself is very cool and I could see it being expanded into something
      fullfledge and successful given enough time. I also really enjoyed hearing their business plan as it was EXTREMLEY detailed and well thought
      throught! Well done to this team!

      <h2>Defense of Saturn</h2>
      I saw much potential in this game yet I believe they failed to deliver. One of my major criticism was the camera angle and how I sort of lost
      the 'depth' feeling. This could've potentially been solved by allowing the main camera to move around, sicne they were exploring 3D graphics
      anyways. Another slight disappointment is that they promised a lot during the early demos and status updates that sounded very exciting yet
      failed to deliver on them for the final demo. What was good however was the modelling and the animations for shooting. I also liked that they
      used the Overwatch font (because I personally think it's an awesome font). However, it failed the 'turret defense' feeling by not having enemy
      collision when attempting to build a maze. Surely given more time, they could've made this game great but I believe it sort of failed to deliver
      for this demo in terms of how they hyped it during prior presentations.

      <h2>Quest</h2>
      This 'game' did not really feel like a game to me. Perhaps this project would have been more suited for a course such as Advanced Graphics and
      Interaction but for a "Game Design" course it felt a bit... lost. Sure - they had a 'quiz' element to location baesd points, but where is the
      game component? A quiz with multiple choise as basic as it gets for a game. You can explore AR and gaming in so many different ways, such as
      Arr. Although a very interesting project if continued, it really felt misplaced for the course given almost 0 'game' elements. But perhaps I am
      just being a bit too harsh.

      <h2>Once Upon A Time</h2>
      This was one of my favorites! I love the artwork for the game, I love the level design and I love the overall themes and stories that are told.
      I think what made it so great is that they early on in the presentation put up a link where we can download and test it ourselves during the
      presentation and thus giving us a better understanding of what they were talking about! Tihs is soemthing a few other groups perhaps 'failed' at
      - i.e providing a demo for everyone to try. Sure, only one level was available, but as a demo this was perfect. The level featured great quality
      and they showed the potential expansions of the future. I thoroughly enjoyed their presentation!

      <h2>Knock Off</h2>
      Although the game design for this game is relatively simple I really loved the way they presented the game. This is kind of what games have to
      do to make me notice them - blow me away with some crazy aspect. For this it was the characters - I love that it was world leaders and that they
      stuck to this theme. It made it all so much fun! And yes - I do believe they stayed true to their "Quake" themed aspect. I also felt elements of
      Super Smash Bros and other brawling games. Also once again - having a live demo that people could test made it even more fun and I believe everyone
      truly enjoyed the presentation they put on.

      <img style="width:100%;" src="/resources/DH2650/DSC_2587.JPG"></img><br><br>

      <h2>Timelapse - My project </h2>
      And finally it's time to comment and critize my own project! I saved this for last because I believe I will have the most to write about it. Overall
      I think our presentation went very well. Our presentation was a bit different for others as we sort of focused on the creation process of our game.
      We did this however because we believed that this was the most important part! Our characters have become very dear to us and we wanted to show everyone
      the inspiration behind them and all the effort we put into creating them. All from the early sketches and concept art to the final animation and implementation.
      Christopher Peters asked us if we thought that putting all this effort into the modelling and design of our game was worth it and we answered that yes, we strongly
      believe it was worth it because this made the game OURS and more personal. It made the game into something we've truly poured our soul into and
      we can firmly and proudly say that, yes this is our game and yes we put a ton of effort on it!
      <br><br>
      We made sure to let everyone know that we wanted to produce a quality demo with one level (although we originaly planned for more) as to prove our
      game concept! I definitely believe we achievd this goal and I think (well, I hope) everyone was impressed with what we showed! The creation process
      was very inspiring and I myself learnt a lot from working with such a talented group of people. I'm very content with the course and I do believe
      everyone in my group gave it there all!

      We today went through the last parts that need to get crammed in before tomorrow's presentation. We have successfully created and prepared
      our demo and I think our GDD and website look good too! We have finally come to terms with a proper business plan and are proud of our work.
      Tomorrow I will write my final reflection post about the project and process on the whole.

      Andreas Linn - DICE

      Today's lecture was held by Andreas Linn from DICE. He is a gameplay programmer - a work description that seemed fairly vague at first
      but I believe he did a good job explaining what he does. A gameplay programmer, at dice, essentially handles bug detection and feature
      additions when it comes to direct gameplay. If a designer asks for something to be available for a new weapon they design, the gameplay
      programmer essentially creates the functionality of this function within the game engine. He also gave an example that if for an example,
      a parachute wasn't working the way they intend it to, he is the one who fixes said bug. I believe this presentation was one of the better
      ones as he gave a very clear description of his job, to the best of his ability. It wasn't a pitch about why VR/AR is the future, but it
      really felt like a back-to-basic, "hey i am a programmer at dice. This is what we do and how coding pipelines work" which I am ver interested
      in. I also enjoyed listening to the solutions to some of the technical challenges that occur when working with larger projects, such as
      the Git solution and how multiple people work on the same scene.

      Today we had the opportunity to meet as a group in class and to discuss what needs to be completed by next week. We all also got to try
      some new things that Tianli had implemented in the demo. I believe that the direction our project has gone is very good and the cuts
      we've made to content will definitely make our project have more of a professional look as well as shine with quality. It is now my
      responsibility to set up our Deliverable website and I will do this today.

      The main topic of today's talk was Virtual Reality development and funding your own game studio. I thought this was one of the better
      talks as the speaker, Daniel Nyberg, was very down to earth and spoke as someone who knew what we wanted to hear. It was very interesting
      to hear how he struggles with motion sickness yet wants to develop VR games and also his journey of being involved with three different
      VR companies. What I took away from this talk was that I would probably not be comfortable starting my own company despite it's clear
      advantages. While I do enjoy risk taking, I also enjoy having some form of a safetynet in life and it seems like a very big risk being
      responsible for something like that. I was unfortunately not able to stay for the Q/A session but hopefully that was good too.

      Today we had a status update presentation. Since I was sick during the hello world demo I took it upon myself to work extra hard for
      this presentation. According to my teammates we di not get great feedback from the hello world demo but I do believe that Today
      we got way better feedback. The video above is the video we had playing in the background while presenting and discussing our project.
      We got great feedback. We had people express their suggestions for the things we asked for and we also got feedback inregards to
      marketing stuff. We are still debating where our microtransactions should be placed within the game. Whether or not to have characters
      unlocked at the start or if it's better to have maps as microtransactions. Our game has however made great progress!

      <b><a style="font-size:120%;">John Fuller from Avalanche Studios</b></a><br>
      Hearing John Fuller talk about what it's like to work at Avalanche and the challenges they face was very interesting. Since Avalanche
      specifically focus on creating open world sandbox games, it allowed for us as students to niche our questions to that area
      and gain insight into how you perfect an entire genre. I personally thought it was very interesting when he spoke about
      what it takes into creating a large open world experience and at the same time make it not feel empty.
      <br><br>
      Although it was out of the scope of the presentation, it was very cool to hear how his journey of physics and the
      Havok engine landed him a job at Avalanche and how this journey worked. I think physics is fairly underrated within
      games engines and the amount of work that goes into it is extreme.

      This post will just be an update post on our project! Below you will find some screenshots. My task in the project
      right now before the demo is to make some sort of an enemy system within Unity. This of course comes with it's
      challenges and it is therefore unknown whether or not this will be in the demo! However, we do have a lot to show.
      Tianli has put together the 'beat' system and it is looking pretty good and I believe this is what we will show.
      Creating this enmey system has however taught me a lot about C# as a programming languages as well as how to use
      Unity in more effective ways. I believe the end result of our game will be very good once it all comes together!
      <br><br>
      Beyond this we also have awesome artwork coming in from two other team members which includes character models
      and background scenes for the gameboard! Our last team member is ensuring we stay on task and is dealing with a
      lot of the managing tasks such as GDD and documentation. All in all I believe our end product will be very good.
      <br><br>
      <img style="width:100%;" src="/resources/DH2650/enemy1.PNG"></img><br>
      This is my enemy system so far. It will spawn waves and the enemies that spawn will move towards the player
      which in this case is green in the middle. What I have to do still is add projectiles that go towards the player
      and also do some cleaning and organization within the code.
      <br><br>
      <img style="width:100%;" src="/resources/DH2650/beat1.PNG"></img><br>
      Here is the beat screen we currently have. There is also music that has the same beat as the moving/clicking mechanics!

      Reflecting on Lectures So Far

    <hr style="width:80%; border:2px solid orange;">
    <div class="blog_content">

      So far we have had three guest lectures from people within the industry. Below I will write a little bit about
      each one and what impact they left on me!
      <br><br>
      <img style="width:100%;" src="/resources/DH2650/Apex-Construct.png"></img>

      <br>
    <b> <a style="font-size:120%;"> Oskar Burman from Fast Travel Games</a></b>
      <br>
      It was very interesting to hear from Oskar Burman about the potential of VR gaming in the future. He seems
      to be very optimistic about the potential market for said games and that it will only get better. Some of the key
      parts I took away from the presentation was how to divide up games into categories when looking at platforms. Although
      they were so obvious to me - hearing it listed out with graphics made me think. A phone game is usually played in short bursts
      but multiple times throughout the day. So the goal of a phone game developer is to create a game that the user can not only
      enjoy for a couple of minutes, but a game that will also bring them back at a later time. This is most likely why the cooldown
      style games are so popular these days. By this I mean games that have for example, after you perform one important thing in the game,
      you cannot perform the same action again until 8 hours later UNLESS you buy this sweet power up. This is how the game company
      earns money from the free to play genre. The goal is to find a fine balance where you give the user the option to pay or wait
      with end goal of bringing them back to play.
<br><br>
      The second category dealt with traditional games. For most people you know that when you sit down and play you generally play for
      a couple of hours or as long as you can. This works because real console and computer games are designed to be played that way
      to begin with - you expect the user to play for a longer period of time. VR now becomes the third category and this is where
      things get interesting. A VR requires, essentially, an appointment. There is a lot of setup required and generally a player
      does not play for too long as it is quiet an exhaustive experience. Oskar Burman said that a VR session is approximately 30
      minutes at a time. This may however mean that after the session is over, the user takes a bit of a break and then jumps back
      into it again after they've recovered. So designing a game that allows for this type of play is an interesting process!
<br><br>

        <img style="width:100%;" src="/resources/DH2650/Paradox.png"></img>
<br>
        <b><a style="font-size:120%;">Jörgen Björklund from Paradox</b></a><br>
        I really enjoyed this lecture as we got to hear insights on how the publishing world works - perhaps something normal
        gamers don't think about when accusing developers for the 'misdoings' of a game. There is huge heated discussion online
        about monetization models, specifically in game lootboxes, and it was interesting to hear from Jörgen how most of the
        decisions are made as this shed some light on the situations happening in the real world (I am of course right now
        talking about Starwars Battlefront 2 by DICE and the huge controversy surrounding this). I did not know for example that
        once a publishing company agrees to a project (after much 'input' from them as to how the game should be) they OWN the
        intellectual property. Of course it makes sense to a certain extent as they are the capital venturists and want to have
        exhaustive control over the project they funded. However from a creator's perspective it must feel very weird to sell
        your idea just like that. He did discuss what happens when a publisher and developer fall through and that it does happens
        ocassionally but it's very scary to think about.

      <br><br>

      <br>
      <b><a style="font-size:120%;">Tommy Palm from Resolution Games</b></a><br>
      The presentation by Tommy Palm gave a cool insight into how mobile games are designed to be profitable and a brief history
      on what they were prior to the iPhone. It was very interesting to hear him talk about the future of VR and mobile gaming as
      well.
