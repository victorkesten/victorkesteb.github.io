Otherwise I've recently started going to events/hackatons in my spare time. Mostly related to helping organisations develop ideas and prototypes by the use of technology. Also looking forward to the Crash Bandicoot on PS4 game release!</td></tr>

I am extremely interested in how programming plays its role in creating art forms and that design married with technology can produce amazing experiences.

With that I mean I'm interest in basically everything that crosses my path, from science to arts to stupid internet things. Now, on a deeper level, academically speaking, I like to think about how technology and society interact, how this things we create end up shaping us. in fact that is the reason I left Brazil to study here. <br> As for hobbies, in my spare time lately I have been trying to learn how to code (basically JavaScript and HTML). Also, I am passionate about music (I used to play guitar and violin) and in the past months I have grown an interest on cooking. "</td></tr>
		 <tr><td>"I did my Bachelor in Computer Engineering and worked for almost 3 years as a software developer. Even though I love programming, I realised that programming on a topic that I have no interest in, is really depressing. So I applied to KTH and moved to Stockholm to learn more about a topic I'm interested on programming. <br>I like playing video games in my free time. I can be found browsing Steam for survival, city-building games or indie games. I follow most of AAA titles too. I also watch movies, tv-series and read books.
