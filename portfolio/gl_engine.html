<!-- What is Lorem Ipsum?
Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum. -->

<b>Project Premise</b><br>
The first main goal of this project was to create a foundation for a 3D game engine. This then turned into more of a sandbox project where instead of creating a fullfledged game, I could explore different aspects and techniques of generating computer graphics. 

<br><br>
To demonstrate how this engine could work in real life I created an example first person shooter game that is reminiscent of the old Doom or Wolfenstein3D games. Below you can find images and a video demonstrating the engine. This game, with minor extensions of the original engine (such as simple AI, sprite and Physics support), was very easy to put together given the foundation the engine provided. 
<br>
Bellow there is a list of features included in the engine. 

<br><br><br>
<b>List of Features:</b>
<ul>
<li>OBJ Loading</li>
<li>Texture support</li>
<li>Dynamic Shaders</li>
<li>Shadows</li>
<li>Phong ? shading</li>
<li>Anti Aliasing (See bachelors paper)</li>
<li>Proper generic lighting </li>
<li>Modular support</li>
</ul>

<!-- Why do we use it?
It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).
