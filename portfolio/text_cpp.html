<h2>Why a text based adventure game?</h2>
In every programmers career one sooner or later comes up with the exciting idea of creating a text based adventure game that can be run through any Terminal. Zork - one of the earliest interactive computer games, is very well known example of this genre. My first encounter with this genre was during a course project during my first year where we had to design a game called World of Zuul using Java. I used this idea later on when working with a Raspberry Pi like device, exploring MIPS architectures and created said game in C for the controller. 

<br><br> Now a few years later I decided to recreate a project of the genre but in C++ with a much stronger foundation and efficient modular/extendible functionality. When I wrote the project, ironically the end product was not to create a fun game but rather to create the foundation to be able to create a fun game. The most important part was extendibility - How can I create a game that has the potential of becoming something huge and great?
<br><br>
I have put together a test game that can be run locally along with a link to the repo. This test will demonstrate how the text based game engine could be used.
