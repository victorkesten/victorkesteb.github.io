<h2>Snake</h2>
Snake is one of the classics when it comes to old school games. Essentially everyone knows what it is and how to play. This implementation of snake is created with JavaScript and

This game originally had a database backend that supported highscores and logins by the same user from different computers. However, the database server is no longer accessible and so now it's only a local game intended for in-browser use with no saving mechanics.

<h2>Battleships</h2>
Another game that dates back way before I was born (obviously). But how about if you could play it against yourself (or a team mate) with random Battleship placement? Exciting? I think yes!

<h2>Pokédex</h2>
Although not a game, it's something I would like to share as it's a fun project! In my first year at University I decided to create a Pokédex in Java. This was before I knew SQL and proper database support, but nevertheless I am still proud of the outcome.

<h2>Why a text based adventure game?</h2>
In every programmers career one sooner or later comes up with the exciting idea of creating a text based adventure game that can be run through any Terminal. Zork - one of the earliest interactive computer games, is very well known example of this genre. My first encounter with this genre was during a course project during my first year where we had to design a game called World of Zuul using Java. I used this idea later on when working with a Raspberry Pi like device, exploring MIPS architectures and created said game in C for the controller.

<br><br> Now a few years later I decided to recreate a project of the genre but in C++ with a much stronger foundation and efficient modular/extendible functionality. When I wrote the project, ironically the end product was not to create a fun game but rather to create the foundation to be able to create a fun game. The most important part was extendibility - How can I create a game that has the potential of becoming something huge and great?
<br><br>
I have put together a test game that can be run locally along with a link to the repo. This test will demonstrate how the text based game engine could be used.
