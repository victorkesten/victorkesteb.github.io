The ultimate goal of this project was to create something that combined a number of
unique modern technologies while also creating an intricate asymmetrical coop experience.
The final product ended up becoming a proof of concept and an excellent research
opportunity. It allows for opportunities to look at how people interact in VR spaces when given a limited
set of tools and senses. It's the project I am most proud of in my portfolio and therefore it deserves a
thorough explanation!
<br><br>
The game puts one player in a VR headset and a second player by the Microsoft Surface SUR40. From now on
these will be referred to as the 'Immersed" and "Illuminator" respectively as to not confuse the two. The Immersed
player is in complete darkness and the only way for him/her to see their surroundings is through the help
of the Illuminator. The illuminator carries a physical flashlight that is meant to be used for it's
original purpose - to light up dark spaces. The Illuminator shines the light on the table which displays
a map of the Immersed player's world space. The two players need to work together through the use of light
in order to complete specific objectives.
 Below you can see our experimental setup in
our development studio. My role primarily focused on network programming, Unity programming and hardware callibration/coordination efforts.

  This project was so extremely well received not only by the visualization staff
  and professors at our University, but also the people testing it so we decided to unanimously keep working on it beyond the course
  scope during Spring of 2018. This project will be submitted to a number of game design/visualization/interaction
  competitions as well as become a benchmark within the Visualization Studio at KTH of what
  is possible when using the technology available. The plan is to add 3D printed models that can be
  recognized on the board, to test monitoring the player walking using the Microsoft Kinect
  and have the speed in which they move be reflected within the game in real time. There will also be
  two research projects carried out in regards to the project. We expect to create scientific publicactions
  and submit these to an appropriate Journal for peer checking. This project is now called Cimmerian Island and can be
  found on my portfolio page. <br>
