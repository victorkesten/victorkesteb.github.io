Modern day society and its technology is advancing at a pace never seen before, especially when it comes to the way humans can interact with machines when attempting to complete either virtual or practical tasks. Not only are technologies on their own very convenient and provide the ability enlighten day to day tasks but also when combined can prove to be extremely powerful. When solving more complex tasks with the use of advanced technology, tasks can be divided up into unique areas and it generally becomes easier to divide responsibility of solving said task by more than one person. The key to success generally then becomes and relies on how efficiently and effectively the two or more people communicate with each other and how their collaborative interactions end up solving the set out task. What this project investigates is how communication and collaboration is performed, executed and improved upon when you limit and restrict the way two players normally can communicate in a gameplay environment by not only restricting what each player sees in terms of what the other player is doing but also how critical it is to have light in a VR environment.
<br><br>


Cimmerian Island is in itself a fairly simple game were it not for the use and implementation of advanced hardware technology. There are two players – one being the “VR Player” and the other the “Board Player” and their task is to unanimously attempt to leave the “Cimmerian Island” that the VR player finds themselves on at the start of the game. The VR Player naturally wears a VR headset and controls the main player within the game with the use of either a joystick or the respective VR controllers in a typical FPS fashion. The Board player finds themselves in front of a Microsoft Surface Board displaying a birds-eye-view, or in other words – an enlarged mini-map, of the island that the VR player finds themselves trapped upon. They are also equipped with a physical flashlight used as intended – to light up areas – but should be shined upon the surface board screen in order to light up the world for the VR Player. This is the first catch of the game – the VR Player is in a world of darkness, thus the name Cimmerian island, and the only way for light to ‘appear’ is through clever use of the items available in game or through the help of the Board player as they have the power to light up certain areas. On the map in which the Board player controls and sees they can only see an outline of the VR player once the fog of war has been cleared and together their goal is to get off the island.

This project has been received with great enthusiasm from many different parties not only from game design studios but also researchers as it opens up many research questions. My key responsibilities was ensuring project stability through network, hardware and graphics programming. The project is partially created in Unity3D.
<br><br>
Below you can find our submission video as well as a comprehensive write up for CAWARDS, describing the project in greater detail. It was nominated for 2 awards - "Best Interaction Design" and also "Technical Excellence".
